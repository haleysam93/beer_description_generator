Because construction was still underway when the horse vanished, a stone remains missing from the church to this day."

17,La Fin du Monde was developed through 18 months of research on a unique strain of yeast originating from Europe. It is brewed in honor of the intrepid European explorers who believed they had reached the “end of the world” when they discovered North America ‘the new world’.

28,"Redhook Blonde combines the best attributes of a flavorful golden ale with the refreshing qualities of a lager. The ale is brewed with three different malts and two hop varietals.

29,"Ah, Spring…the season that keeps us guessing. Will it rain, or will the sun be out? Do I take advantage of the last days of skiing, or the first days of hiking? Do I put on jeans, or dare break out the shorts? The season comes with enough uncertainty, so Redhook gives you something you can always count on…our Nut Brown Ale. This medium dark beer is layered with rich malty aromas and flavors of chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and a hint of vanilla. Although it may be dark in color, it’s refreshingly smooth and highly sessionable. Nut Brown is the perfect beer for spring."

31,The IPA That Launched Generations of Hop Fanatics
32,A porter with hints of chocolate & coffee balanced by subtle smokiness
33,"At Arrogant Bastard Brewing Co., we believe that pandering to the lowest common denominator represents the height of tyranny—a virtual form of keeping the consumer barefoot and stupid. Brought forth upon an unsuspecting public in 1997, Arrogant Bastard Ale openly challenged the tyrannical overlords who were brazenly attempting to keep Americans chained in the shackles of poor taste. As the progenitor of its style, Arrogant Bastard Ale has reveled in its unprecedented and uncompromising celebration of intensity. There have been many nods to Arrogant Bastard Ale...even outright attempts to copy it...but only one can ever embody the true nature of Liquid Arrogance!"

35,Formerly Blue Moon Harvest Moon Pumpkin Ale

Brewed with two row malted barley, water, Noble hops and yeast, along with maple syrup, it was then aged several months in oak whiskey barrels before being bottled. At the time it was considered the world's strongest beer, and a precursor of today's Extreme Beers."
40,"An American-style wheat ale brewed with malted. Low hopping rates allow the refreshing aroma and citrus flavor of a late addition of lemon grass to dominate. This unfiltered beer retains all of its protein, flavor, and some of its yeast, resulting in a traditionally cloudy appearance."
41,"A touch of Maple Syrup is added to each barrel of our award winning Maple Nut Brown Ale to impart a roasted sweetness. This addition balances the nut flavor produced by Munich, caramel and chocolate malts used in the brewhouse, producing a drinkable brown ale."

43,"White Ale's are Belgian style beers, often refered to as ""Wit"" beer. Our version of this classic style is a wonderful spicy brew, infused with orange peel and coriander spices. It has a crisp refreshing flavor and a slight 'white' haze from the large percentage of wheat used in the mash."
44,"This beer is 6.2% when released in Europe, US labels say 6.9% due to labeling laws."
45,"A beer that has a dominant malty taste. This beer’s origins in a monk’s recipe are reflected in its heartiness. The Pope of Beers, Conrad Seidl, describes it as: “Almost black with a very slight red tone, a sensational, festive foam and truly extraordinary fragrance that at first summons up visions of greaves lard. The first taste is of mild fullness with an accompanying coffee tone, which becomes more dominant with the aftertaste. There is very little of the sweetness that is frequently to be tasted with doppelbock beer.” The Ayinger Celebrator has been ranked among the best beers of the world by the Chicago Testing Institute several times and has won numerous medals."
46,"Wheat ale with spicy, crisp taste. Unfiltered. "
47,"This beer was first brewed in 1978 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of our brewery. It has a golden-yellow color with a slightly flowery yeast, honey-ish aroma, tastes a little spicy and is full-bodied in initial taste, mild before swallowing and soft with a refined sparkle and fades with a well-balanced hint of bitterness. It is an especially drinkable and harmonious beer. Conrad Seidl, known as the Austrian “Pope of Beers”, on the Jahrhundert Bier: “It is a malty beer that pronounces the precious earthy quality of malted barley.”"
48,"Up until the Second World War, dark beer was the predominant beer type in the Munich area. The hard water found in the region played a special role in producing this specialty. In his book “Beer International”, the world-renowned English beer writer, Michael Jackson, accurately describes the Ayinger “Altbairisch Dunkel” as: “A good example of its kind. Impenetrably dark with a golden-brown gleam when held up to the light, and with a warm aroma and malty taste, while summoning up coffee taste sensations on going down. It is brewed from five types of malt (two of which are torrified dark), and it is only lightly hopped.” It is produced using the traditional double fermentation process."
49,"“The union of wheaty freshness and dark malt often produces a fullness of taste and complexity”, explains the world-famous English beer commentator Michael Jackson. "
50,"Hoppy, farmhouse saison with champagne like effervescence; flavors include ginger, spice, orange and toasted grain."
51,"Abbey was Ommegang's first beer and was styled after Dubbels produced by Belgian Trappist monks. A deep, rich and malty ale, Abbey uses several Belgian specialty malts and spices resulting in a very aromatic, flavorful beer."
52,"This is the award-winning original American brown ale, first brewed as a holiday specialty, and now one of our most popular beers year-round. Northern English brown ales tend to be strong and dry, while southern English brown ales are milder and sweeter. Brooklyn Brown Ale combines the best of those classic styles and then adds an American accent in the form of a firm hop character and roasty palate. A blend of six malts, some of them roasted, give this beer its deep russet-brown color and complex malt flavor, fruity, smooth and rich, with a caramel, chocolate and coffee background. Generous late hopping brings forward a nice hop aroma to complete the picture. Brooklyn Brown Ale is full-flavored but retains a smoothness and easy drinkability that has made it one of the most popular dark beers in the Northeast."
53,"Plenty of IPAs will promise you the moon and the stars, looking to seduce you with words of smashing bitterness and hops everlasting. Actually, we're not here to ""blow you away with a lupulin cannon,"" or ""peel the enamel off your teeth."" East IPA is a clean, drinkable IPA that's packed with flavor and offers a bold balance, not a smack in the head. American hops soar in the bright piney aroma, while East Kent Goldings hops bring the taste of stone fruits and firm bitterness from IPA's ancestral British home. Give our East IPA a try with some rich crab cakes or salmon, strike up a conversation with farmhouse cheddars, and find harmony alongside spicy dishes. East IPA's blend of tradition and exuberance sets the standard for hop-driven deliciousness."
54,"In the late 1800’s Brooklyn was one of the largest brewing centers in the country, home to more than 45 breweries. Lager beer in the “Vienna” style was one of the local favorites. Brooklyn Lager is amber-gold in color and displays a firm malt center supported by a refreshing bitterness and floral hop aroma. Caramel malts show in the finish. The aromatic qualities of the beer are enhanced by “dry-hopping”, the centuries-old practice of steeping the beer with fresh hops as it undergoes a long, cold maturation. The result is a wonderfully flavorful beer, smooth, refreshing and very versatile with food. Dry-hopping is largely a British technique, which we’ve used in a Viennese-style beer to create an American original."

56,"Belgian Strong Pale Ale, re-fermented with Bordeaux wine yeast"
57,"Buffalo Bill's Alimony Ale was originally brewed back in 1987 for a customer going through a divorce. It has gained reputation as one of the most eccentric brews, from reports in the Wall Street Journal and Newsweek. No longer one of the bitterest beers in America, just one of the best."
58,"This American pale ale opens with big citrus and pine notes, then smooths out with a faint toasted malt character and dry, slightly bitter finish. Denver Pale Ale is your go-to beer from city to trail and back again, no matter what the time or season."

64,2007 - 10.0%
65,"Our interpretation of a classic English beer style is copper-colored, medium-bodied and pleasantly hopped. Its flavor is delightfully complex: tangy fruit at the start, with an assertive hop crispness and a long malty palate that one well-known beer writer has compared to the flavor of freshly-baked bread."
66,"We brew our Maibock to be hugely malty & subtly finished with a variety of continental hops, with an eye-pleasing russet brown color. Prosit!"

77,"Our Amber is a sweet, malty, medium-bodied ale with a spicy, floral hop finish. It's brewed with 2-row Pale, Crystal and Chocolate malts. And we hop it with Mt. Hoods and Cascades. We're as proud of it today as we were back in '89. And over the years it's earned more than 25 Gold Medals. Not that we're keeping track or anything."

82,"Not just the iconic ale of the capital, London Pride is an all-British affair that unites a nation of beer drinkers. It’s brewed with entirely home-grown hop varieties - Target for bittering and Northdown, Challenger and Goldings for aroma - but the soul of the beer is unquestionably in the malt. "
83,Formerly Schneider Aventinus.

We have returned once again to the age-old recipe and recreated that gloriously smooth, honey-coloured piece of history from times gone by. And all is brewed with due reverence to the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516."
91,"Introduced by the Vikings, spruce and pine ales were very popular in the Scottish Highlands until the end of the 19th century. Many early explorers, including Captain Cook, used spruce ale during long sea voyages since it prevented scurvy and ill health. Shetland spruce ale was said to ""stimulate animal instincts"" and give you twins. Alba is a triple style ale brewed to a traditional Highland recipe from Scots pine and spruce shoots pickled during early spring. Pure malted barley, is boiled with the young sprigs of pine for several hours then the fresh shoots of the spruce are added for a short infusion before fermentation."
92,"From the Gaelic ""Groseid"", Since at least the 16th century Scots monks and alewives brewed indigenous drinks from cereals, wild herbs and ripe fruits. Tibbie Shiels green Grozet was immortalised by such Scots literati as Sir Walter Scott, Jas Hogg. (The Ettrick shepherd) and Robert Burns whoconsidered it a most convivial drink. Brewed with lager malt, wheat, bog myrtle, hops and meadowsweet then secondary fermented with ripe Scottish gooseberries."
93,"Brewed in Scotland since 2000 B.C. heather ale is probably the oldest style of ale still produced in the world. From an ancient Gaelic recipe for ""leann fraoich"" (heather ale) it has been revived and reintroduced to the Scottish culture.

97,The pride of Nova Scotia.

Our Traditional IPA ale is naturally carbonated, dry-hopped & unfiltered like the old days."

110,"It’s OK to be a Wee Heavy. Much has been made of the ills of smoking. Jinx thinks there’s nothing wrong with it. For years, he stood strong with his peat-smoked whiskey malt mash. He held his head high when others made fun of his wee heavy physique, becoming a mainstay in Magic Hat’s Night of the Living Dead Variety 12-Pak. People said he’d never attain an Original Gravity above 15.1 degrees Plato or an ABV above 6%. He proved them wrong. Take Magic Hat into the next alellenium. Vote Jinx."

114,"Put a Little Spice In Your Life It’s time you had a beer that’s made up of more than just malted barley, hops, yeast and water. We’re entering a new era of craft beer, one where we need not be suppressed by outdated brewing standards and boring the purity laws of foreign countries. Coriander, orange peel, malted rye…Miss Bliss is all the rage of the future age! Put a little spice in your life, America, and kiss boring beer goodbye."

117,"When you bring a glass of this dark copper ale to your lips to take your first sip you will notice the aroma of cinnamon. There is no aromatic hop added that might overpower the distinct spice scent. The medium body of this beer is formed from caramel and pale malts. These create enough body to support the spices without making the beer excessively rich. Bittering hops are added to counter the sweetness of the malt and spice. The finish of the beer is a blend of cinnamon and nutmeg. The combination of these two spices results in a balanced, pumpkin-pie flavor."
118,"We started brewing this beer as a summer seasonal in 1993. There were some great IPAs out in the Pacific Northwest, but no local IPAs on the east coast. We wanted to have a local IPA, so we brewed one. People absolutely loved it, and so did we. So we made it a year-round beer, and it’s now our bestselling beer and our flagship."
119,"The character and complexity of Harpoon Octoberfest comes from the malt and hops. When looking at a freshly poured Harpoon Octoberfest, you will notice the garnet-red color with a firm, creamy head. The beer’s color is from a blend of Munich, chocolate, and pale malt. The thick head results in part from wheat malt added to the grist. The hop aroma of this beer is not overpowering but it is present. Tettnang hops add a subtle spice nose that blends with the malt character. This beer is full-bodied, smooth, and malty. Willamettehops are used to provide a gentle bitterness and to balance any residual sweetness present from the malt. The finish is soft and malty with a mild bitterness."
120,"A blend of specialty malts gives this beer a velvety mouthfeel with roasted notes and a hint of chocolate, balanced by a subtle hop aroma. Hard to describe but easy to drink, Harpoon Dark is rich in character and light on the palate."
121,"UFO Hefeweizen is an American unfiltered wheat beer. Perhaps UFO’s initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head. The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO. Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing. When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image."

The familiar rich amber lager we now know by this name originated in Vienna and migrated to Bavaria by the 1850s. Like the classics, our version is deeply malty, with just enough hops to provide a sense of balance. But our version lightens up the body a little to avoid being too sweet, making for a crisper drinking experience. We start with the classic Vienna and Munich malts, and use a few other types as well, for greater complexity as well as an easy drinkability. Slightly more hop bitterness as well as some pleasing hop aroma gives the Berghoff Oktoberfest a bit more punch and personality than the original."

Zatte more than lives up to expectations in this respect. It is a full-bodied, golden beer with a scent of fresh fruit mingled here and there with a hint of grain. The flavour is slightly sweet, ending with a fine, dry aftertaste. A delicious beer that can be enjoyed in all seasons."
152,"An amber, craft beer with generous amounts of hops and alcohol. This copper-gold beer is a real heavyweight and a must for beer lovers. The liberal quantities of malt and bitter hops create a complex, full flavour. It starts as slightly sweet with malty aromas of chocolate, fruit and grain, while the bitter hops stand out nicely in the aftertaste. A feast for the connoisseur!"
153,"Our bokbier that rings in the autumn every year. Dark and full-bodied, but not as sweet as you might expect. The fine, light brown head holds for a long time while the dark, black-brown beer releases aromas of the roasted grains, a bit of coffee and dark fruit. The aftertaste is pleasantly dry."
154,"One of our flagship beers, slightly different in flavour every year! A splendid, maroon-coloured beer with fine aromas of spiced fruit, orange peel and well-roasted malt to delight the nose. The flavour is a spicy balance of caramel, citrus and slightly bitter hops to restore that warm feeling during the dark days of winter. If stored in a cool, dark place, IJndejaars will keep for years."
155,"Our bokbier for Easter; not too sweet, thereby producing a fine flavour. The flavour and aromas give a nicely balanced mix of fruit, coriander, yeast and hops. An enjoyable combination in which the bitter element gets an additional boost from the lightly roasted malt. The aftertaste is slightly sparkling, with a long-lasting, fresh, sweet flavour. An excellent beer for celebrating the arrival of spring!"
156,"A prize-winning beer that we brew specially for De Bierkoning. The fruity, bitter hops and lightly roasted malt complement each other perfectly in this light brown beer.

A huge malt body is matched to a heady blend of chocolate, dark fruits, and other aromas. Intensely bitter in its early months, the flavors will slowly meld and grow in depth as the beer ages."
165,"Old Foghorn® is brewed based on historic English barleywine methods. It is highly hopped, fermented with a true top-fermenting ale yeast, carbonated by a natural process called ""bunging"" to produce champagne-like bubbles, and dry-hopped with additional Cascade hops while it ages in our cellars. Made only from “first wort,” the rich first runnings of an all-malt mash, three mashes are required to produce just one barleywine brew."

A lush, complex aroma teases the senses with juicy grapefruit, citrus, pine, spice and candied caramel malts. Mouth-feel is creamy, with a silky, medium body and modest carbonation."

Fermented at high temperatures with our in-house ale yeast, the final product releases a roasted aroma with faint hop overtones. The flavor presents a grainy, slightly burnt malt background. It delivers tones of dark chocolate, accented with a slight coffee bitterness to round out the flavor. Stegmaier Porter is opaque brown in color and boasts a full, creamy head."

191,"Introduced to Scotland by Welsh druids in the 9th Century, elderberry black ale was part of the Celtic Autumn festivals when the ""elders"" would make this strong ale and pass the drink round the people of the village. The recipe was taken from a 16th Century record of domestic drinking in the Scottish Highlands. Elderberries were used for many natural remedies to cure sciatica, other forms of neuralgia, influenza and rhumatism as they contain tannins and fruit oils. Ebulum is made from roasted oats, barley and wheat boiled with herbs then fermented with ripe elderberries."
192,"At least four hundred years ago, the coastal & Island farmers of Scotland used seaweed beds to grow their cereal crops.

201,"Among the mythical characters living in Fairyland, some are more unusual than others. Malcolm, for example, is different because of his accent and his kilt: when it comes to beer, his favourite is Mc CHOUFFE. The delicious flavours of aniseed, liquorice and toffee tickle his taste buds. If you listen to him, he will boast of its ruby sparkle, its smooth bitterness and its strong character, worthy of his native Scotland. Although robust, Mc CHOUFFE goes down as easily as LA CHOUFFE."

204,"BBC's version of an India Ale Ale, named as such because of its popularity with British Troops in colonial India. The beer’s alcoholic strength and high hopping rates (hops also act as a preservative) helped it withstand the long ocean voyage from England. Brewed with lots of pale ale malt and caramelized wheat and barley, we then add large quantitites of American Columbus, Simcoe and Cascade hops. Then we allow the hot wort to run through a bed of raw hops (known as the hopback) prior to fermentation. This process adds a burst of hop aroma and flavor. Big, bold and bitter, just like Jeff Gesser."

A Maibock is very similar to a Helles/pale bock,. Maibocks we originally brewed for the coming of spring, hence the name Mai (German for May). The Mad Brewer Maibock is fairly light in color. It is similar in color to our Pipe Organ Pale Ale, but very different in character. Don't let it get you though, it's a very strong beer at about 7% alcohol. It has a very clean and malty nose. The hop bitterness is evident, but not dominant. The Mad Brewer Maibock will finish quite full and have a delicate sweetness."

The aroma leads off with an appealing fruitiness, produced by our house yeast, which gives way to a rich caramel aroma which, in turn, is followed by the herbal character of our finishing hops.

After a large pie, don't say Decaf Espresso, say Damn Good Stout."

279,"This doppel is started with a base of Pilsen malt. It is colored and flavored by caravienne, caramunich and special-B malts. A large portion of Munich malt is used for its distinctly German flavor and aroma, as well as a little aromatic malt. Finally, there is some carapils to add to the full body. It is also flavored with moderate amounts of Yakima Perle and German Hallertau hops to balance the malty sweetness. Though the IBU level is pretty high, this is not a hoppy beer. It's just that it takes a lot of hops to balance out such a malty beer. (O.G. 20.5P/1082. Hops - 46 IBUs)"

592,"Oosik Amber Ale is a true German-style altbier, brewed with pale, Munich and crystal malts. Deep amber with copper highlights, Oosik sports a toasted and caramel malt profile, balanced by traditional noble hops. A special yeast strain ferments this ale at cooler lager temperatures, giving it a smooth malt character and a clean finish."
593,"The chill of a Colorado high-country winter calls for a beer with extra flavor and strength. Here it is. At over 7% alcohol, with a sturdy texture and rich flavors of caramel and chocolate, our holiday seasonal is the fermented equivalent of a good fire."
594,"An ale we think General Bennett C. Riley (Fort Riley’s namesake) would have enjoyed while here in the Flinthills. Riley's Red Ale represents the midrange of our flagships. Try it once and you will see why our regulars are particularly fond of it! Based on the classic Dusseldorf-style-Altbier, our Red Ale os copper toned with a hint of caramel aroma, and topped off with a dash of European hops, creating a wonderfully balanced Ale."
595,"As its name suggests, Éphémère is an ephemeral ale that comes and goes with the seasons. It was developed as a series to feature a seasonal fruit in a refreshing, lightly spiced white ale. The label depicts a fairy, an ephemeral spirit associated with fruits picked at the peak of ripeness during each harvest season. She first appeared in the spring of 2001 and has since been celebrated on a variety of seasonal fruit ales such as apple (brewed all year long), cranberry, blackcurrant, peach, raspberry and blueberry."

600,"There's something about a warm summer day that calls out for a cold glass of great beer, and this classic Czech-style lager is sure to fit the bill. Crisp, golden and refreshing, Summerfest is the perfect choice for soaking up the sunshine. Summerfest is a Czech-style lager featuring a slight malt sweetness, a spicy hop flavor, and the crisp finish you want on a hot summer day."
601,"This is the same Blonde that you've had for years, only now it's toasted... Nicely toasted. Notice that it has an enhanced biscuit toasty taste and a light, dry finish. This is not a heavy blonde, but once in a while, we like to dress her up and get her toasted by actually roasting 30 lbs. of a special English malt right in our pizza ovens and adding it to the brew. It is still clean and lager- like, with just a little more of everything (except calories - 107/12 oz.)."
602,"This beer emphasizes hops from beginning to end. The clean herbal aroma comes from dry hopping, that is adding hops after fermentation. For this we chose a variety of hops grown in the Yakima Mountains of Washington. The flavor starts with a delicious malty character and builds quickly to a big hop finish. There is no harsh lingering aftertaste, we have carefully crafted this brew so that the assertive dryness at the end starts to fade just as you are ready for another sip."
603,"Simple and delicate, this straw-coloured ale presents round malt flavours of the biscuity, cereal variety. Complemented by subtle hop bitterness in the finale, it makes for a fresh and accessible offering for seasoned connoisseurs and beginners alike."

605,"Inspired by the German Rauchbier – smoked beers from the Bamberg region – Charbonnière is a dark amber beer with a distinctly smokey aroma, obtained by the use of wood-smoked malt during the brewing process. It is sustained by a slightly sweet malt backbone, permitting the smoked malt to express itself freely with every sip."
606,"Medium-bodied and robustly flavorful, Mudshark Porter sports a satisfying dry finish and rich notes of chocolate. Smooth, dark, and bittersweet cocoa flavors linger on the palate from first pint to last. A wonderfully smooth and creamy porter, Mudshark ranks among the favorites of a special class of aficionados known for their appreciation of fine beer: the Mighty Fish Brewers. We assert that after a day well-spent exploring the great outdoors, a friendly pint enjoyed with barbeque, sharp cheese, or-but, of course!-chocolate has the power to help sustain weary souls and rejuvenate tired bodies."
607,"This tasty English style pale ale gets its charm from our unique, proprietary house yeast strain. Combined with American malts, hops and Alaskan water, our pale ale is supremely balanced between bitterness and full malt flavor."
608,"This beer is not currently being brewed by August Schell Brewing Co. It may have been brewed on a contract-basis in the past, but is not one of Schell's products."
609,"This beer is gold in color, very malty, full-bodied and has an increased hopping rate over the rest of our brews. Traditionally brewed for a May release date."
610,Now brewed here:
611,"In 2002, when the SAQ requested an exclusive new high-end product, Unibroue responded with Terrible. Given its dark colour and 10.5% alcohol content (a first for Unibroue), we knew that this Belgian quadruple-style ale might very well be greeted with reticence."
612,"This brew combines 2-Row Pilsen malt, a hint of Crystal malt, and of course, plenty of malted wheat. A hint of blackberry at the finish makes this beer a real thirst quencher! For the health conscious, Blackbeary Wheat has less than 6 grams of carbs and only 110 calories per bottle!"
613,"Golden unfiltered ""wheat"" beer. Smooth quality with hints of banana and cloves with a spicy finish."
614,"A classic Munich style Heffe-Weissbier, with a light slightly fruity flavor and an underlying sweetness."
615,"US import name ""Erdinger Weissbier Crystal Clear"""
616,Formerly known as Burragorang Bock.

629,"American style Pale Ale, medium body, copper colored, medium bitterness, medium to low maltiness, very sessionable, brilliantly filtered, very well balanced with hops and malts. Columbus Hops give our moderately bitter Pale Ale an outstanding finish making it the perfect bittersweet partner to our burgers, pizzas or sausage grinder."
630,"Dunkel Weizen is the dark version of the regular golden-yellow Weissbier or Weizenbier (more commonly called Hefeweizen in North America), the spritzy, creamy Bavarian wheat beer with pronounced clove, vanilla, banana, apple, bubblegum, and sometimes nutmeg flavors."
631,Amber Ale falls into the category of a Northwest Style Pale Ale. The brew gets its name from an amber coloring and is medium in body with medium caramel character. Our Amber Ale is brewed from copious amounts of Cascade Hops which give the brew its bitterness and aroma alongside a medium malty character.
632,"Our Bavarian Weisse is a top-fermented, traditional German wheat bier. Phenolic, ester with a slight banana aroma typical of this fine German ale. The perfect springtime brew. It’s like a liquid welcome to warm weather. Prost!"
633,"Not to be confused with a German Roggenbier, beers that fall into this category contain a notable amount of rye grain in the grist bill. Bitterness tends to be moderate, to allow the often spicy and phenolic-like rye characteristics to pull through. Brewed using American hops and filtered clean."
634,"In the Bavarian tradition, this crisp, clean golden-hued pilsner is brewed with German variety Magnum hops, then lagered for 30 days for superb drinkability. Provo Girl is the type of pilsner you would find in the Munich area of Germany."
635,"Inspired from the now wavering English Porter, the American Porter is the ingenuous creation from that. Thankfully with lots of innovation and originality American brewers have taken this style to a new level. The hop bitterness is minable and well balance with dark malts."

642,"The Pilsner beer was first brewed in Bohemia, a German-speaking province in the old Austrian Empire. Pilsner is one of the most popular styles of lager beers in Germany, and in many other countries. It’s often spelled as “Pilsener”, and at times abbreviated, or spoken in slang, as “Pils.” Classic German Pilsners are very light straw to golden in color. Head should be dense and rich. Red Rock’s version is well-hopped, brewed using Noble hops such as Saaz, Hallertauer and Tettnanger. Lagered for five weeks and filtered bright. Prost!"
643,Brewed to be our strongest tasting lager using extra malt and hops in the brewhouse and fermented to give a smooth slightly sweet well balanced beer at 7.3% alcohol.

649,"Conceived in a dimly lit room on a blistery cold night in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, but born and raised here in Marshall Michigan. The Reserve Special is the oldest of all beers in the Dark Horse family. It has an incredibly “thick” presence and when poured into a glass its color is so dark it’s eerie. The flavors explode onto your taste buds with heavy malt, roast, and chocolate, but stay very balanced. The Reserve Special Black Ale has a hard time being called a stout or porter but it fits nicely into the category of a delicious strong black ale."
650,"Using an old world recipe, we handcraft this wonderous beer with Belgian wheat malt and fresh raspberries. In fact, six pounds of fresh British Columbia raspberries go into making every case, resulting in a tart, crisp flavour. Our double fermentation process produces an intensely fresh raspberry aroma and palate, abundantly obvious from its ruby-red colour and pink head. During the aging process, the hop and fruit acids balance out the residual malt sugars to give this beer more taste bud bang. Amsterdam Framboise is best served chilled and shared with friends."
651,"A ""double hopped"" (dry hopped) unique American lager based on traditional European Pilsners with a crisp refreshing body and lots of taste. We add hops in the kettle and then again before finishing for aromatic quality."

661,"Six Months of aging brings a soft smoothness to this sweet, complex ale. The result is a “sipping beer” that doesn’t seem like one. By this we mean that Legend Tripel is a deceptively strong beer to be shared with friends and family in celebration and moderation. Legend Tripel is brewed on a Belgian abbey style yeast strain which imparts combinations including banana, clove, apple, pear, even bubblegum. Serve with mild cheeses, roasted pork or turkey."

667,"John Smith’s Extra Smooth was launched in 1993 and is now the nation’s No.1 ale. The boffins say it has a distinct cereal character, with malty, caramel notes being complemented by some fruitiness. But we just think it’s a right good pint."
668,"John Smith’s bitter, which is still going strong, is a malty, bitter sweet ale with a slight fruitiness and a bitter aftertaste – we probably took the words right out of your mouth. John Smith’s Original can be enjoyed in cans at home (3.6% ABV), plus there’s the Cask Ale available on the bar (3.8% ABV)."
669,Named for Carl Dinkelacker.

675,"Although there are a lot of “Irish red” beers out there, only a few of them feature the slightly roasted flavor that made this style legendary. Not surprisingly, this flavor comes from the addition of a small amount of roasted malt, the same thing that gives the beer its deep ruby hue. Ours also uses hops from the United Kingdom to lend even more Irish authenticity to the style. It is the perfect brew to enjoy while watching St. Patrick’s Day parades from Boston to New Haven and beyond!"

In the tradition of the Belgian Wit style, Upland Wheat Ale is unfiltered, allowing suspended yeast to create a cloudy, golden appearance. This is an everyday, every meal type of beer. It’s comforting on a cold winter day and refreshing on a hot summer evening. That’s why it’s one of our most popular brews and a flagship beer of our brewery."

Although we add no sugar, color or flavors, the resulting beer is a hazy pink color, with citrus aromas from the wheat and a flavor that is neat and tart. While this beer is low in bitterness, it is not overwhelmingly sweet, making it a thoroughly drinkable beer for the season."
738,"7.4% ABV, 25 IBUs - This Franco-Belgian style Farmhouse Ale has an effervescent body and a light straw color. Rabbid Rabbit, with it’s light malt body, augmented by spices, is a complex and frothy beverage with a deceptively high alcohol content. March release."

750,"Sweetwater Pale Ale is brewed exclusively for the restaurants owned by Great American Restaurants; Carlyle Grand Cafe, Artie's, Mike's American and Silverado. The recipe and techniques were developed by Nick Funnell, the Brewmaster, who makes the same beer at the Sweet Water Taverns."

Iron Rat's aroma presents hearty roasted coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruits and a touch of molasses. On the pallet this imperial stout immediately showcases espresso notes and a bakers chocolate with a velvety mouth feel that keeps you lingering for more."
755,"An exceptionally drinkable beer that is smooth and crisp with a slight citrus finish, this ale is named to honor the endangered Florida panther. With only 100 panthers left in the wild and as a state symbol, the panther is Florida's True Blonde. The Florida's True Blonde Ale is easy drinking and big in flavor with a hint of hops on the nose. Perfectly adapted to the Florida climate, this sessionable ale is satisfying all year."
756,"This Egyptian inspired brew is spiced with ginger, myrrh, and orange peel ... very complex."
757,This is accomplished by using very “young” (partially fermented) Steelgaarden Wit. A Wit bier uses similar raw materials as a lambic. This makes a suitable and convenient replacement for the lambic we removed from the wine barrels. The “funk” or good bacteria left in the wine barrel is the catalyst to start the souring process. The brewers further inoculate the new beer with a culture grown in the “Mother”.
758,"The Wulff is styled after the Austrian Kristall Weizen, a clear and filtered wheat beer."
759,"The Brown Ale style originated in the pubs of England, where beer drinkers desired a beer that was both flavorful and complex, but at the same time mild enough to be a session beer. The Santa Fe Brewing Company's interpretation of this style uses a combination of high mash temperature, hard water, and low-alpha acid hops to produce a product that is both true to the style and distinctly Santa Fe. Brewing jargon aside, Santa Fe Nut Brown Ale is an easy-drinking beer, mild, smooth, and always a favorite."
760,"Anything but a typical American Pale, Santa Fe Pale Ale is as full bodied as its most robust English counterparts, while asserting its American origin with a healthy nose resplendent with Cascade and Willamette hops. It finishes with a well-balanced combination of the subtle, almost Pilsner-like maltiness accentuated by the German yeast used to brew this Santa Fe classic, and a hop bite sufficient to leave a lingering smile on the face of any fan of American Pale Ales."
761,"A huge, sweet Barley Wine with complex caramel malt notes, balanced by generous hopping and a high alcohol content. This fruity and malty beer is best enjoyed while keeping warm in the brutal winter months."
762,"In the image of an English IPA, Legend Golden is a big, full-bodied brew with the perfect balance between malty sweetness and hop bitterness. Years ago, as an experimental brew, this underdog of a beer found its way into the hearts of Legend patrons and became a cult classic in Richmond. Legend Golden has been described as a ""high class malt liquor"" by a notable source. This strong ale sports a rich gold color, an aroma of sweet malt and clean hops, and an earthy, fruity flavor."
763,"Our American style Pale Ale is a hop lover's dream. We craft this copper colored ale to supply a moderate bitterness and an aggressive hop flavor and aroma. Willamette hops pitched early in the boil give a clean, soft bitterness. Late kettle hops include Northern Brewer, Simcoe, and Chinook for plenty of pungent pine and citrus character. Judicious amounts of four specialty malts add counter and depth. Expect a medium bodied brew with an assertive, complex flavor and a dry finish."
764,Why are the Bavarian Royal Family and King Ludwig so important to brewing history? The Bavarian Royal family had sole rights to brewing of Hefe-Weizen in Bavaria for 200 years. No wonder they are leading experts on wheat brews.

769,"Brewed at either Clybourn or Wrigley location, not at the production brewery."
770,"Our Oatmeal Stout is a classic British-style stout brewed with flaked oatmeal and roasted barley. Freshly-roasted coffee beans, cocoa and touches of raisin and dried fruit dominate the aroma of this super dark ale. The richness of the grain blend is balanced by the nutty character of the roasted malt, the creaminess from the oatmeal flakes and a dose of hops."
771,"Brewed for the Montgomery Inn in Dublin, OH."

The beer is brewed with malted barley, malted wheat and oats and has a malty taste with a smooth herbal finish. The aroma has a hint of herbs and spices mixed with dark malt. Jopen Koyt is the only gruitbeer from the Netherlands. Gold medal winner at the European Beerstar competition in 2009 and a silver medal at the European Beerstar Competition in 2011."
775,"German inspired sour wheat beer. The obvious and domineering acidity of this beer is obtained by letting the unboiled wort go sour for several days. The Solstice d’Été is made complete by the addition, during the fermentation process, of a phenomenal quantity of whole fruit (raspberries or mangos or cherries) which compensate for the sourness of the beer. The result is a very refreshing beer where both acidity and fruity flavours dominate wholeheartedly."
776,"This is our flagship beer and the one we are most proud of. But a warning to you. This is a beer drinker's beer. True to the IPA style, it has a dormant, almost overpowering hop bitterness. A three week dry hopping process ensures that the beer is preserved, as was done centuries ago."
777,Replaced by Saddleback Ale.
778,"Based on an extinct yet favorite tipple of the De Ranke owners, Nino Bacelle and Guido Devos, De Ranke Kriek emulates the famed Oud Kriekenbier from the defunct Crombé brewery in Zottegem. De Ranke Kriek is a mixture of two blended soured pale ales and Girardin lambic, all steeped in whole fresh cherries from Poland and then aged for six months. A unique and much sought after Kriekenbier."
779,"Old Faithful Ale is golden blonde in color with a crisp body and light malt sweetness. We cold conditioned this ale to give it a pleasantly smooth character and dry palate. The domestically grown noble hops give this beer a light, floral hop aroma, making it exceptionally easy to drink."
780,"A whole-cone Cascade dry-hop shines with a malty body in our balanced pale ale. The result, a citrusy aroma backed with malt that pairs beautifully with subtle flavors, especially with citrus dressings and seafood."

This combination makes for a very aromatic character, as well as a truly authentic English flavor which you must taste to believe. “Hopheads” will love this brew!"
791,"A rich, full-bodied beer with an oatmeal creaminess, a hoppy flavor and balanced aroma with a hint of honey."
792,"Named after Little Rock's historic section of town, this porter gets its dark, rich reddish-brown hue from a combination of crystal and chocolate specialty malts that give it a full-bodied malty flavor and aroma."

3,"Perła Chmielowa is the leading product of the brewery. The finest quality ingredients, the use of the best hops of the Lubelskie region, and the original centuries old recipe have the greatest influence on the unique attributes of this beer, its characteristic bitterness and the golden color. Owing to this Perła Chmielowa is able to meet the demands of the most exacting gourmets and boast worldwide appreciation."

5,Malts: North American Select Pale Malt

7,"Hand-built with Montana barley. Kettle hopped with massive amounts of bittering and aroma hops for an invigorating , yet well-balanced Montana pale ale."
8,"A special treat with a light palate, rich body and fruity tones. Light clove and lemon aroma are gently laced with banana. Vision Weiss is served absolutely unfined (and, of course, unfiltered)."

10,"An ultra-premium all-malt and traditional German-style ale at 5% alc./vol. Deep copper to light brown colour with an aromatic focus on malt elements of fresh baked biscuits and toast.

15,Bitter was originally a draught ale served very fresh under no pressure (gravity or hand pump dispensing only) at cellar temperatures. Lucky for you today its available everywhere!
16,"Like the rich, dark brews of southern England this traditional ale draws on specialty malts such as chocolate, caramel and black patent. “Nut Brown Ale” is a deliciously flavourful dark beer like those popular in early Nova Scotia."
17,A light German-style beer made with Anaheim chiles and smoked Ancho peppers. A 2006 Great American Beer Festival Bronze Medal Winner in the Fruit and Vegetable Beer category anda Wynkoop specialty.
18,Offically retired as of early 2006.

20,"Looks dark, tastes light. It's Ontario's favourite dark lager. A dark beer that is slowly brewed with Canadian grown malted barley, specialty coloured malts, imported hops and pure cultured brewers yeast."
21,"St-Louis Gueuze Fond Tradition is a pure traditional gueuze aimed at connoisseurs. It has the pure taste of a true gueuze based on a blend of young and old lambics. Fruity apple aromas stand out. When tasting, the slightly sour touches, characteristic of lambic beers, make their presence felt. It is very dry in the finish."
22,"An explosion of hops dominate this deep golden ale. Brewed with four varieties of hops & dry hopped with three other hops, the flavor is powerful. Not a harsh bitterness, but a full hop flavor."
23,"This style originated in the area of Cologne, Germany. It exhibits the more desirable features of both ales and lagers. Our Kölsch is pale gold with light body and a slightly dry palate. It has a mild bitterness and delicate hop aroma. This beer is a clean and pleasant thirst quencher, which earned a Bronze Medal at the 1998 Great American Beer Festival."
24,"A British style, the I.P.A. originates from the aggressively hopped and high-alcohol beers which were shipped to the British troops in colonial India. Pale to medium amber in color."
25,"Another British style that has a roasted nut-like aroma. Brewed with a number of dark malts, which lend a complex malt character. This beer does not have a lot of hop bitterness, only enough for balance."
26,"This is a dark version of the weizen beer style. The grist contains a large portion of wheat, which lends a distinctive note to the malt body and aroma. This style is traditionally un-filtered and can have significant haze and cloudiness. Our Dunkle Weizen is brewed with a traditional Bavarian weizen yeast, which gives it a very pronounced clove and spice character, as well as a fruity aroma."
27,Yet another British style. Stouts are black beers which have strong roast and burnt characteristics. The dark malts used give this beer a wonderfully rich aroma and taste. It is not hopped very heavily and oats are used in this particular style because they lend a fuller mouthfeel.
28,"This is a ""slow-pour"" stout, which is very easy drinking and has a velvety texture, mild bitterness, and rich full roasty malt character."
29,"A very malty beer with a fair amount of residual sweetness. The hop character is subdued, with a delicate aroma and just enough bitterness to balance the sweet finish. This beer is intended to be consumed at a leisurely pace, since it has some strength."
30,"This is the lightest style of weizen beer. The grist contains a large portion of wheat, which lends a distinctive note to the malt body and aroma. This style is traditionally unfiltered and can have significant haze and cloudiness. Also, it has been brewed with a traditional Bavarian weizen yeast, which gives it a pronounced clove and spicy character, as well as banana and bubblegum, and even some slight vanilla notes."
31,"A very pale beer brewed as a lager and which has a crisp, assertive Czechoslovakian Saaz hop character. This beer took 6 weeks to produce because the strain of yeast we used has a slow and cold fermentation, which results in a very smooth beer."
32,"Brewed especially for early fall, this scrumptious lager has a deeper red color than most lager beers, and a rich maltiness. Not only does this beer match the color of autumn leaves, but it also goes well with many foods; particularly red-meat dishes with herbs, as well as grilled fish. And of course, this beer complements the classic German combination of sauerkraut and wurst."
33,"The warming sensation of this strong beer goes nicely with the cold fall and winter months. It has a very rich malt character, residual sweetness, delicate bouquet, and alcohol strength. This beer is served in specially shaped thistle-glasses, which allows the beer to be held in the hand to warm up and release its aroma into the flared top-portion of the glass."
34,"This is a classic English Bitter. It is well balanced and has a light hop and malty aroma. The color is somewhat darker than that of pale ales, leaning more towards ruby red. Light in body and alcohol and easy to drink, this beer is one that can be consumed comfortably throughout a long evening at the pub. Owen's Ale won a Silver medal at the Real Ale Festival 2001, in Chicago, Illinois."
35,"A slight variation of the porter style in that we used beechwood smoked malt in a portion of the grist. This lends a distinctive smoke character to the taste and aroma. We also use Munich, Caramel, and Chocolate malt in this beer. The hop character comes through a little in the aroma, but is mostly in the bitterness to balance the intense malt character. 5.8% alcohol, by volume."
36,"This beer has a subtle hop aroma from the addition of hops directly to the fermentor (a technique referred to as ""dry-hopping"" or ""dry-hopped""). It has a clean and light taste, with a dry finish. The crisp dryness is derived largely from the use of Munich-style malts in the grist. Caramel and Chocolate malts were also used, resulting in a beer which is very easy to drink but also has some maltiness in the finish. All the hops used were imported from Germany and Czechoslovakia (Hallertau and Saaz hops). The beer was brewed as a special beer for the 1999 wedding of our Brewmaster, Tom."
37,"This is a very special type of beer. It is about as strong as they come. We actually brewed this beer using a sour-mash technique, and then fermented it beer with our house ale strain. After a short conditioning period in the fermentor, the beer was moved into kegs for long-term storage. So this beer can be considered ""keg conditioned"". It typically requires many months of maturation before it reaches its peak flavor balance. This beer could be considered an aperitif, or it can be enjoyed with a meal. 10.5% alcohol, by volume."
38,"Our award winning oak aged oatmeal stout is specially aged in used oak barrels acquired straight from the Jim Beam distillery in Kentucky. The barrels impart flavors of vanilla, bourbon, coconut, chocolate, and more. Served nitrogenated for that extra smooth mouth feel. This Bordeaux of beers goes great with a wide assortment of meats, rich pasta dishes, and desserts."
39,No longer brewed/owned by Pabst.
40,"Advances in malting techniques made possible paler coloured malts and heralded the arrival of Pale Ales onto the brewing scene in the 1800s in Britain. The most famous Pale Ale brewers came from Burton, where the hard water perfectly suited this new style of beer. Propeller “Burtonizes” its water to emulate this famous style. Crisp, hoppy and dry, Propeller Pale Ale is a delightful interpretation of a classic British brew."
41,Formerly Menabrea 150° Anniversario Lager
42,"Tyskie is a pattern Gronie taste lager in the world. Perfectly composed flavor profile provides a strong bitterness and malt fully, while satisfying the desire."

50,Inspired by SIBA's Wheat Beer challenge in 2001 we produced a 4.8% ABV beer using 40% Wheat Malt and 60% Malted Barley. To underline the continental heritage of this beer we uncharacteristically brewed with choicest Hallertau hops from Germany. This award winning brew has been described as 'wheat and sweet'.

56,"An annual Bristol tradition, Old No. 23 revives an English farmhouse brewery practice of making a complex ale to set aside for special occasions. Our version, while painstaking and time-consuming to brew, rewards the connoisseur with an ale that has the depth and complexity of a good brandy or single malt scotch. Massive quantities of malt and hops, a long aging time and limited availability make this a special ale worthy of its reputation."
57,"Inspired by West Coast I.P.A.'s, but brewed with Michigan style. The Crooked Tree is heavily dry hopped to give it a big aroma of pine and citrus. The flavors are big, yet very balanced between fresh hops and malt. Often described as ""grapefruit"" our hops give this beer an excellent fruit flavor that finishes dry."
58,Formerly known as Dark Horse Amber Ale

Like our Irish brethren, we infuse our stout with nitrogen gas for a creamy head that “collapses” when poured. Brewed with American, Canadian and English grown barley and American hops."

62,"This Belgian beer is brewed in the style of the Trappist Monks. Belgian Candi Sugar, Pilsen, Aromatic and Caramunich malts are balance by E. Kent Goldings, Mt. Hood and Saaz hops to construct a ""Big Beer"". Traditional White Beer Yeast is used to make this beer have a large mouth-feel and lingering spice notes in the finish."
63,Dragonmead's signature product! This is the ultimate Belgian style. The very high gravity of this beer is balanced by the smoothness of its finish. Banana and Clove aromas come from the Belgian yeast strain combining with the generous dose of Belgian Candi Sugar. The Saaz hops help to give this beer a balanced bitterness with no noticeable hop aroma.
64,Sweet Orange Blossom Honey is combined with Belgian two-row malted barley and Munich malt to create another Belgian classic. Tetternger and E. Kent Goldings hops are added to round out the finish of this beer. The aroma of the honey remains without the sugary sweetness.

67,"Get ready to bask in the glory of the frothy head’s floral bouquet. Relish the citrus accents from the abundance of dry hopping. This one’s sweet, yet balanced. Malty undertones shake hands with the hop character for a finish that never turns too bitter."
68,"This light beer is fashioned after German, summer wheats. Summer wheat gives this beer its crisp, refreshing character. We serve it with a slice of lemon."
69,"A malty and full-bodied European style amber, the Amber's rich color is derived from European Munich and Crystal malts. The malts are carefully balanced with German Hallertauer and Tettnanger hops."

71,"Hallertauer hops from the Yakima Valley of Washington State give this English style pale ale its distinctive flavor and hoppiness. A large amount of malted barley is used in the brewing process which gives Chukkar Ale a full, rich body."
72,This dry stout features a roasted coffee-like bitterness and a clean well balanced palate. A gentle hop bitterness is present. Fantastic with a meal or by itself.
73,"Honoring the stone masons who worked on the State Capitol, the Hotel Fort Des Moines, and many of the other historic buildings in Des Moines, the Stonecutter is a complex and satisfying beer. The beer you need when you're feeling the need for restoration."
74,"Brewed orange peel, coriander, a Belgian yeast strain, and a twist of rye."
75,Custer’s Last Stout is a Foreign-Style stout. It has an initial malt sweetness and chocolate flavor with a dry roasted bitterness finish. It is brewed with English malted barley and domestic Fuggle hops. This variety of hop adds a slight herbal (licorice) aroma and flavor to our stout. Foreign-Style stouts originated when English breweries added more hops and alcohol to their classic dry stouts as a natural preservative. They did this so the beer would survive the long journey to their far reaching empire around the world.
76,The perfection attained in the crafting of this beer is the fruit of experience transmitted through the years and constantly improved by four generations of the Rivera family.
77,Production ended in 2011.

His actions in support of the free-staters in the 1850s was quite notable, but also quite violent and vengeful. A religious zealot with a long family history of insanity, one of Brown's favorite maxims was ""Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins"". During his colorful career with the free state militia, Brown made sure that there was no shortage of the remissions of sins."

It is fashioned after the Kolsch beers made around Cologne. It is traditionally brewed in the Alt Style like our Ad Astra Ale and has about 25% wheat malt. There is just a touch of caramel malt to add the golden color, and the rest is pale malt. The Golden is lightly hopped with Yakima Perle for bittering, and Hallertau Hersbrucker hops for aroma."

A small amount of Wheat malt is used to give extra body to this otherwise ""light"" beer. Hallertau hops balance the malt but impart no hop aroma."
281,The Porter style was almost lost in England with the advent of cheaper and more prevalent alcohols like Gin.

289,"Our Pilsner is a golden and crystal clear lager. The hops lend a pleasant bitterness and a lemony, peppery taste.

Made with thirty percent American winter wheat, Hefeweizen is balanced with sweet golden malted barley and Tettnang hops from Oregon that evoke a hint of spice.

This beer creates an endless variety of sensations with a lingering taste and powerful aroma.

This is the perfect beer after a day out in the cold or for a cozy evening in by the fire."
310,"Originally enjoyed by the working class of England, porters inevitably became a staple in American brew pubs. Our interpretation is brewed with Caramel malt for a rich, toffee-like sweetness and a touch of East Kent Goldings hops.

341,"As the name implies, this is a big beer. Though the style doesn't really exist, think of it as sort of an imperial pale ale. Made with pale ale malt and pale caramel malt, this beer has a light color but a full body. Horizon and Fuggles hops go into the kettle and imported East Kent Goldings are used for the dry hop, giving a distinctly British hop character. The hopping level of 72 IBUs balances the fullness provided by an O.G. of 18P/1072.

Evidence of these first settlers can still be seen in the skillful stone construction of many of the Valley's buildings and barns, including the Long Valley Pub and Brewery. The original walls and graves of a 16th century Lutheran church can still be found just across the bridge on Fairview Avenue. The German Valley Amber Ale derives its firebrick red color from a combination of crystal and specially roasted malts. This is an assertive beer with a notable bitterness and respectable strength. Willamette hops are used in generous quantities to make this pleasantly hop-flavored ale."
563,"Jake was a black Labrador retriever owned by the master carpenter responsible for much of the beautiful restoration work visible in the Long Valley Pub and Brewery. Jake became familiar to the brewer as the dog lounged around the construction site during the hot, 1995 summer days while the dilapidated stone barn was meticulously restored. The friendship struck between the brewer and dog inspired the name of this beer. Lazy Jake Porter is a robust, black beer. Blends of five varieties of malted barley combine to give this beer its assertive flavor and full body. Generous late hop additions complete its bold character. Lazy Jake Porter has received three awards at The Great American Beer Festival and one award from the World Beer Cup."

Aromas of fresh pine and citrus dominate, giving way to deep flavors of nutty maltiness and burnt caramel. A spicy hop bite of citrus peel rounds out the rich mouthfeel. Bittersweet English malts and cut-throat West Coast hops make Godfather a barley wine that is not to be taken lightly. This re-release of Old Godfather is the first vintage of its kind. As a brazenly robust brew, Old Godfather will benefit from years of cellaring, developing new refinements in character over time."

Each new Stone Vertical Epic Ale will be release one YEAR, one MONTH and one DAY apart. With Vertical Epic 03/03/03, we used some pretty interesting ingredients...coriander (a ""Belgian-style"" beer favorite!), alligator pepper (wow, bite into these little gems and you get a bigtime spicy rush of flavor), and a bit of both unmalted wheat and dark roasted wheat. And a blend of Belgian yeast and American ale yeast. And a nice selection of high alpha hops (a decidedly non-Belgian style twist). All told it makes for a dubble-ish taken-to-San-Diego-pushed-to-the-edge-and-slapped-around-a-bit beer. So, treat it gently. It's been abused enough already. Store it upright, cool and in the dark. It would enjoy a nice long rest. It will have plenty of patience. Now let's see about you ... In addition, we are pleased to provide the homebrewing recipe: http://stonebrew.com/timeline/030303"

600,"The Boffo Brown ale is a beer that we brewed years ago and then put it in semi retirement for a couple years while we focused on other brands at the brewery. We have recently put it back onto active duty and are brewing it all year. The beer itself is delicious and is a favorite to many of us here at the brewery. Just as most of our beers it's on the ""full body"" scale pushing the envelope of what an American Brown Ale is to most people. The beer is a very deep/dark color of brown with a nice creamy tan head. The mouthfeel of the beer is very soft and is very drinkable.

610,"Too many strive towards complacency as a goal. We grow up thinking that the ability to become complacent is the equivalence of success in life. True Arrogant Bastards know that this could not be further from the truth. The real beauty, richness and depth in life can only be found if the journey through life itself is looked upon as a constant chance to learn, live and find life’s passion. Passion threatens the complacent, and fills them with fear. We, on the other hand, seek it out. To this end we bring you OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale. Another reward for those seeking new sources of passion, and another point of dissension for those who are not."

642,This is accomplished by using very “young” (partially fermented) Steelgaarden Wit. A Wit bier uses similar raw materials as a lambic. This makes a suitable and convenient replacement for the lambic we removed from the wine barrels. The “funk” or good bacteria left in the wine barrel is the catalyst to start the souring process.

651,"Just in time for St Patrick's Day we are bringing out the new Stout. It feels like we are visiting the British Isles with the two new specialty beers online. We are rolling out a much anticipated nitrogenated version of an Irish Dry Stout. This is the Church Brew Works version of the national Irish beverage, the Dry Stout, the benchmark of which is Guinness Stout. We did some experimenting and made a Nitro version. What does this mean you ask? Instead of straight CO2 as in most beers, we gassed it with Carbon dioxide and then with Nitrogen. The resulting bubbles contain a mix of the two gasses. Draught Nitro stouts are usually poured through a special faucet that promotes gas breakout. With this in mind, a pint of O'Bryan's Irish Stout will have a black color and a tight tan head that will hold for a much longer period of time. It will go down smooth, and due to a lower dissolved CO2 level in the beer it will not have a prickly bite on your tongue. Notice just after the beer is poured, the bubbles cascade in the glass creating a nice visual. The color is so dark you needn't bother trying to look through it. just have another glass. O'Bryan's Irish Stout has an aroma that is dominated by dark roastiness with little or no hop aroma. The body is perceived as bigger than it actually is due to the creaminess added by the mixed gas dispense. The foremost flavor is dark roasted malt with a bit of a rich caramel note. You will also discover a well balanced hoppy finish. It is a very satisfying brew that I know you will enjoy."

Vacationland is an Extra Special Golden Ale that's light in color but full-bodied, with a snappy hop finish. A bit of extra time in the conditioning tank rounds out and mellows the ale.

675,"This black ale has an intense roasted aroma with a hint of chocolate. To taste, it has a nice hoppy bitterness and roasted coffee flavours. It is a dry beer, presenting little sweetness. Its colour may intimidate, but it is an easy drinking beer as long as one enjoys roasted flavours. This beer is pressurized with nitrogen, therefore giving it little effervescence but a compact and durable head."
676,"Équinoxe du Printemps (French for ""spring equinox"") is the quintessential marriage of two great traditions: beer brewing in Scotland, and maple syrup production in Quebec. At the first draught, the mouth is overcome by woody, malty flavours, sustained by a discrete touch of sweetness. The aftertaste brings about the flavours of maple, which are sufficiently present to be appreciated, but never overwhelming the typical flavours of a Scotch Ale. "

How about a light thirst quenching Hefe Weizen (pronounced hefa Vite zen) in the cool environment of our Hop Garden patio. I can hear you wondering, what is a hefe weizen? Allay your fears my friends because I'm going to tell you. A hefe weizen is a special style of beer made with malted wheat and malted barley. Hefe weizens are from Germany. This beer is top fermented (an ale) with a very special yeast. The Hop levels are kept deliberately low in order to bring out the character of the yeast. If you notice the nose of the beer, it has a clove-like or fruity aroma. The grain bill includes 50% wheat malt and 50% barley malt. It is served very carbonated and a touch cloudy. It is cloudy because it is served unfiltered. The remaining yeast contributes flavor, adds B vitamins, and improves the beer as it ages. Selling points for the Heavenly Hefe Weizen are; "

Add in the hop back and the continuous dr- hopping and your starting to get the picture. The beer is finished off with a ""body-bag"" sized hop-bag full of hop cones and oak chips.

When we brew IJwit, we use wheat malt as well as barley malt, which is also how the beer gets its name.

Noted beer reviewer Stephen Beaumont (the Oakland Tribune hails him as a ""widely traveled beer journalist with impeccable taste"") gave this brew 3 stars out of 4.

This is a seasonal that can be found at our brewery from March – May."

Altbier has a formidable malty aroma that is balanced by its hop aroma. The appearance is brownish with an off-white head. The flavor is fairly bitter yet balanced, and has a decent amount of malt character. This is our homage to brewing in the ways of “alt,” so raise a glass in salute to our brewing forefathers."

Three different hop varieties also add their own complexity (and about 78 IBUs). The bittering hop is Magnum. The early aromatic hops are Northern Brewer. The later aromatic Centennial.

1192,"As its name suggests, Éphémère is an ephemeral ale that comes and goes with the seasons. It was developed as a series to feature a seasonal fruit in a refreshing, lightly spiced white ale. The label depicts a fairy, an ephemeral spirit associated with fruits picked at the peak of ripeness during each harvest season.

Clean and crisp, this beer pairs best with a sunny summer day."
1218,"One of Magnolia's most-loved and asked-for beers, an over-the-top IPA we've been brewing since 1999. It's a hybrid, built around English Maris Otter malt and fermented with our English ale yeast but then packed with a powerful hop charge like an American IPA, including big dry hop character. American hops dominate but Maris Otter comes through with a malty counterpoint in a way not often found in this style of beer."
1219,"""Irish Red Beer"" (lager)"

The result is a rich, golden, intense beer with bitterness in perfect balance with residual sweetness."
1238,Slight pale malt aroma and hop balance.

1240,"This a truly double barrelled stout. Coffee beans and roasted malts share many flavor characteristics. They both have roasted and slightly bitter flavors, but each also brings special flavors from the original grain and bean. We have found a fine balance between the two in this beer which showcases equally the flavors and aromas of both. About 5 gallons of cold processed coffee are added to a batch of this special stout (it is its own unique brew, designed specifically to blend with the coffee). Served unfiltered. (O.G. 14.4P/1058.

1248,"Blend two Dogfish Head favorites, add maple syrup and carbonate the mixture naturally. What do you get? 75 Minute IPA."
1249,"Strong brown ale inspired by the beer brewed by Belgian Trappist monks. Very little bitterness, this beer has intense malty and sweet flavours, mixed with the taste of chocolate and caramel. It presents complex red fruit and spice flavours due to the type of yeast that is used during the brewing process. This beer is at its best only after it has aged for six months.

Black malt and roasted barley cast notes of chocolate, dark fruit, and coffee, while earthy hops put the lights out on this shadowy brew with a pleasantly bitter finish."
1255,"A medium bodied lager with a touch of caramel malt flavor, noble hop aroma and a clean crisp finish."
1256,"Five different types of Malt are used in brewing our Brown Porter. Low hopping rates help accentuate the roasty, chocolatey malt character of this very drinkable Brown Porter. Don't be afraid of the Dark!!"

1258,"Brewed to 4.2% ABV, Fireball is a copper coloured premium bitter with Crystal Malt flavours and a long hoppy finish deriving from Bramling Cross and Pioneer Hops."
1259,"Nettlethrasher, brewed to a 4.4% ABV, is a deep copper coloured traditional strong ale, brewed using six different malts and developing interesting flavours from the combined use of English and American hop varieties. All this goes together to make this a mighty mouthful!"

1267,"Formerly Winter Storm (""Category 5"" Ale)"
1268,20 IBU
1269,"A pale (Helles in German, orange colour), strong German lager brewed with 100% Organic malt and hops. A great big white head gives way to a sweet malty note which is quickly followed by the aroma of alcohol. A rich malty flavour with hints of current and oranges is found on the first sip. The hops have a gentle bitterness to balance the malt. The alcohol is not a dominant flavour, but you certainly feel it after a glass or two."
1270,Brewed for the James Moore Tavern at Bolton Valley Ski Resort.
1271,"A unique beer brewed to celebrate the completion of construction of Boscos Little Rock Brewing Company, Boscos Special Golden Ale features the flavor of two row malted barley balanced with just the right amount of hops. O.G. 1048 I.B.U. 18"
1272,"North America's “Original Steinbier.” Brewed using a traditional German technique, stones heated in our wood fired ovens are lowered into the beer during the brewing process, giving the beer its unique caramel character. Awarded “Three Stars” by Michael Jackson, the world’s leading beer writer. Great with salads and lightly flavored dishes."
1273,"During the 1800's, when the sun never set on the British Empire, beer being shipped to the Far East always arrived spoiled. To correct this situation, British brewers added large quantities of hops to their pale ales. (Hops act as a natural preservative.) The result is an intensely hoppy amber beer. Delicious with seafood and all spicy flavorful foods. "
1274,"Stout is one of those beers that has many variations. Most beer drinkers who say “I don’t like stout beer” don’t realize that there are dry stouts, milk stouts, export stouts, imperial stouts and “oatmeal” stouts. Stouts have always been recognized as being good for you (as all beers are) but with oatmeal added, watch out! The oatmeal adds texture, creaminess and all that fiber we all need for various reasons. "
1275,"""Built with lots of chocolate malt and black strap molasses to give this beer backbone. A hint of juniper blends nicely with the chocolate to become a new and unique flavor you can only find at the Alameda Brewhouse. The Porter stands up to the Artichoke, Spinach and Herb Dip as well as the Brewhouse Nachos."""
1276,"""Smooth, rich and creamy. Rye malt blends with roast and chocolate malts to create a new and delicious stout profile, balanced with soft and velvety hops. This northwest original is poured using the traditional nitrogen dispensing method, so it may take an extra minute to arrive, but the wait is worth it. The Black Bear won the Gold Medal at the 2003 GABF in the foreign-style stout category."""
1277,Bronze medal for English style IPA at 2004 World Beer Cup. 60 ibu. Available on draft.

1290,"Named after New Havens historic nickname, this is a true German Pilsner made with all German ingredients."
1291,"Hauenstein Beer is crafted from a classic recipe of well-balanced malt, corn and a little hop character. Its golden color and palatable flavor creates a popular session beer."
1292,"Hop farming once thrived in New York State. In the early 1900s, 95% of all hops used in the US were grown here in New York. However, soon the combination of crop disease & prohibition put an end to local hop growing. Today, there's a new movement afoot to bring commercial hops back to NY. The Ithaca Beer has teamed up with Pederson Farms (Seneca Castle, NY) to create a Double IPA brewed with 100% NY hops."

The perfect days end for the Stump Jumper in all of us. Brewed with pale, crystal, black, chocolate roasted malts, oats, flaked barley, Perle and Challenger hops."
1296,"Coffee! Coffee! Coffee! Dark and rich, but not as full-bodied as our stout. Start out with a simple English Ale recipe, darken it with some black patent malt, and then give it a kick with 50 pounds of Java Joe's finest organic coffee beans."
1297,"While about one third of the grain bill for this beer is wheat malt, the most important recipe detail is the addition of 300 lbs. of tart pie cherries shipped in from Oregon. Tart cherries are used so that the flavor of the fruit isn't simply fermented away from the beer. If sweet cherries were used, the majority of the cherry flavor would be fermented away as the sugars are converted into alcohol."
1298,"A malt dominated beer with roasted malt, chocolate, nutty and or toasty flavors. Medium to high bitterness with noticeable hop aroma and flavor. Brown to dark brown color."
1299,Lederer Pils is the classics from Lederer: it's very hoppy and really beautiful on the finish - just as a pilsner should be.

1305,American Blonde Ale brewed with strawberries.
1306,"Lucky Lager was introduced to beer drinkers in 1934. The name Lucky was selected from a name-search contest. Fully fermented, Lucky Lager uses select ingredients and hops to deliver a remarkably clean, crisp-tasting beer."
1307,"Our most popular beer, Märzen (Maert-zen) is a smooth, mildly sweet, auburn colored lager. This beer originated from Bavaria, where it was brewed in March (Marz in German) and stored in caves to be enjoyed during warmer weather. At the end of September, any remaining kegs of Märzen were consumed during the two week celebration which became famous as Oktoberfest. We hope you'll enjoy it year round."
1308,"Porter was first brewed in London, England in the early 1700’s. At the time two basic beers existed: a light and a dark. The dark was more expensive and drinkers got into the habit of mixing the two to stretch out the premium brew. A wise brewer began making a medium dark beer to save the barkeeps from having to mix at the taps. The beer was named after its biggest fans: the porters handling baggage at the local train stations. This brown porter is deep ruby in color and transluscent."
1309,This medium-bodied beer uses a variety of Belgian caramel malts to produce a sweet malty flavor and ruby red color. Imported hops lend a noticeable spicy aroma to this classic red ale.
1310,"""Blend of Imperial Stout and Imperial Red Ale aged for one year in bourbon barrels."""

1313,"""American-Style India Pale Ale"""
1314,"As the name implies, Mother’s Milk is a dark and creamy milk stout. Hints of oatmeal, chocolate and of course, milk make this brew have a remarkably smooth and silky finish, a classic example of the style."
1315,"A classic Scotch Ale. Scotch ales are typically sweet and malty, with a very subdued dose of hops– just enough to provide balance. AleSmith Wee Heavy is a wonderful interpretation of this traditional Scotch style."
1316,"Rebecca's Revenge is a German schwartbier. A very drinkable lager with notes of dark malt to lend a roastiness that is not overpowering. Try it with an open mind, and step into the dark."
1317,"You could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 75 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think they’ll be quite pleased."
1318,This deep mahogany beer is full bodied with a dense brown head balancing malty sweet chocolate and caramel flavors with the coffee-like character of black malt. Just enough hops are added to highlight the deep rich malt character.
1319,"Lite and refreshing with a hint of wheat malt flavored with orange peel, coriander, and clover honey."

1323,"A new Vertical Epic will be released every year, with the goal being to collect them all and have a Vertical Epic tasting once the final Epic is released on 12/12/12. Each new Stone Vertical Epic Ale will be release one YEAR, one MONTH and one DAY apart. This time around we used some unmalted wheat, just the right touch of Kaffir Lime Leaf, and a really cool Belgian yeast. The result is a bit like a strong Biere de Garde / Saison-esque influenced beer coupled with some aromatic Bavarian Hefeweizen style phenolic banana esters, and a backnote hint of lime from the lime leaf."
1324,"Slight hop bitterness, light copper color. The Steamer is brewed with lager yeast but fermented at ale temperature. This uniquely American brewing style results in a crisp, heavily hopped, but well balanced brew that has an impressive head. In the early days, a cask of this lively beer released a heavy mist when tapped, hence the term “steam”, a bit of history in a glass."
1325,"New Delhi Freight Train is brewed to honor the classic English India pale ales. In the days of sailing ships, IPA was brewed in England to be shipped to India and the preservative effects of hops and alcohol were needed to withstand the long journey. While certainly a very hoppy and strong beer it is slightly less so than the huge American style IPA's. Flowery, assertive hops are balanced by a firm malt platform. NDFT is a signature series of Chris Erickson."

It’s a beer with strong amber hues and dominating hop flavours and tastes. It is however well balanced through the presence of a combination of malts. This beer is usually dry hopped, a tradition that is adhered to by Dieu du Ciel!. The bouquet of the beer consists of floral hops. In the mouth, the bitterness is quite strong, without being extreme, and the alcohol makes its presence known, without being domineering. The aftertaste is dry and less syrupy than a barley wine. Thus, it is a very complex and bitter beer, but always well balanced."
1333,"The Grande Noirceur (Great Darkness) is a dense black beer with robust roasted flavours. Its imposing bitterness is balanced by the presence of complex malted, caramel notes.

When we changed it into a Belgian Style Triple, Death thought it would only be appropriate to bring something from that beer into this beer. So he picked the mailbox, and we weren’t about to argue with him. You can say what you want about him, but that Death sure has a big heart.

It's a national medal winner, and a year round favorite."

Hefeweizen is light in body and color as it is brewed with 50% wheat malt. The cloudy appearance of the beer is due to the yeast that remains in suspension.

1443,"A traditional India Pale Ale, the Elissa IPA is very hoppy with a properly balanced malty body. Elissa has huge hop additions in the kettle that give it a wonderful bitterness and is then dry-hopped in the fermenter to create the pleasant floral, hoppy nose. Our reverse osmosis water makes the bitter very soft with no harsh notes to it. The maltiness is derived from British Maris Otter malt.

Málokdo dnes ví, že toto svrchně kvašené pivo vyrobené z ječného a pšeničného sladu bylo původním typicky českým pivem, které naši předkové pili od raného středověku až téměř do konce 19. století, kdy v oblibě definitivně zvítězilo „nové“ spodně kvašené pivo plzeňského typu. Svrchní kvašení dává tomuto pivu nezaměnitelnou zvláštní lehkou chuť, kterou někteří milují a jiní k ní nacházejí cestu jen pozvolna. V současnosti se toto pivo pravidelně vyrábí prakticky pouze v Pivovarském domě. Podává se s plátkem citronu."

Upravili jsme si proto český název tohoto piva na Májového kozlíka, a tím je i dáno, kdy si na něm u nás můžete pochutnat. Je to opravdu silná polotmavá „šestnáctka“ se sladkohořkou chutí, která se výrazně odlišuje od chuti běžných piv."

1645,"Available exclusively at Turner Field in Atlanta, GA."
1646,"This beer was specially brewed for Dieu du Ciel’s sixth anniversary. It reflects the recent tendency of American brewers to push all beer styles to the extremes. This lager is therefore quite strong in alcohol and it has a sharp but delicate bitterness, like all pilsners. The beer is full-bodied and well balanced thanks to the delicate sweet flavours that come through."
1647,"Brewed to coincide with Germany's famous fall celebration, our Casco Bay Oktoberfest is a truly authentic UR-MARZEN.

1657,Brewed with Mexican coffee.
1658,"This is a classic German Dopple Bock. Like all of our beers it is made in strict accordance to the German Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of Brewing, which is water, malt, hops and yeast only! Lobotomy Bock is made from five types of specialty malted barley including Munich, black patent and other premium malts. And finished with two types of hops, Sterling and Perle added at the boil and again at the finish for the perfect flavor balance.

1667,Named after a local street which gained fame as a location in the Henry Huggins and Ramona Quimby books for children written by Beverly Cleary.
1668,"Scotland’s rugged soils are not conducive to the cultivation of hops that grow readily in England, so during times of political strife Scotland’s southern neighbor would deprive Scottish brewers of their hops. The resourceful Scot turned to his native heather as a flavoring for his ales. Heather grows wild in the rockbound highlands and when added to the beer yields a silky aromatic result. Our Scottish Ale is brewed with a large amount of both malted barley and heather producing a rich-bodied ale with a sweet finish true to the style."

1685,"The Duck-Rabbit Milk Stout is a traditional full-bodied stout brewed with lactose (milk sugar). Because lactose is unfermentable by brewer's yeast, it remains in the beer. The subtle sweetness and fullness of flavor imparted by this sugar balances the sharpness of the highly roasted grains that give this delicious beer its black color. All year long, Milk Stout is our number one selling beer!"
1686,"Rich, malty and full of surprises. This recipe is in a constant state of evolution."
1687,"Gold Medal Winner – 2004 Great American Beer Festival. This double white ale is brewed with a Belgian yeast strain, plenty of coriander and curacao orange peel."

Aromatic hop varieties and types of burnt malt render this ale its delicate bitterness that blends surprisingly well with its slightly sweet undertone."

1706,"Homewrecker is a double strength India Pale Ale, meaning hop bitterness, flavor and aroma take center stage, with plenty of malt character to support it. Brewed with over half a ton of pale, wheat and caramel malts, we then add nearly 30 lbs of hops to make one 7 barrel batch. American Columbus, Simcoe, Centennial and Cascade are added at 6 different points in the boil. Then we strain the hot unfermented ber through raw hops to further extract flavor and aroma. Be careful though, we pushed this one past 10 percent alcohol, so if you start to hallucinate, quickly chug a Michelob Ultra to sober up."
1707,A lightly hopped golden ale with a refreshing and delicious taste. Pleasing and easy to drink.
1708,"A full bodied, deep-brown ale, crafted in small batches with English malted barley and 2 styles of English hops. Enjoy the rich, roasted finish!"
1709,For That Extra Krunk
1710,"Each fall, our brewhouse looks more like a greenhouse as thousands of pounds of wet hop cones arrive within hours of being picked by some of our favorite local hop growers. Acting quickly, we then load up these wet hops into what will become Harvest Ale – an impossibly aromatic and bright IPA bursting with fresh pine, melon and citrus notes. Our ode to the beauty that is the wet, American hop."
1711,"What more can we tell you but this amazing organic ale is our best seller when available fresh in season. Faceplant is brewed with imported organic malted barley, brown sugar, and molasses. After a day on the slopes, tip back a few fresh free range Faceplants to warm the soul... Careful, the name says it all!"
1712,Flavored with Fine Coffee and with faint Chocolate Malt flavors with just a moderate amount of bitterness for a tasty treat. Good with your favorite dessert or just by itself.
1713,"Our salute to Belgian style fruit Lambic beers, with a distinctly Californian twist. We add select parts of whole oranges at precisely the right point to our amber recipe beer, and the result is this magical, orange sweet beer we call Orange Blossom Amber.

1715,This old brewery favorite is rich in malt flavor with a hoppy aroma. Union Street is unfiltered and has a deep chestnut color. The full body and crisp bitterness make a perfect beer for autumn.
1716,"Who’s afraid of the ""big bad BRETT?"" We’ll tell you who: winemakers! Because of our close proximity to several hundred wineries, we often get winemakers visiting our brewery. (After all, it takes a lot of great beer to make great wine!) Because we use 100% Brettanomyces yeast to ferment Sanctification, most winemakers will only smell the glass, and only a very few will venture to taste the beer. They think the Brettanomyces will attach to their clothing and end up in their winery. A simple solution was offered: keep a smudge pot burning at the door of our brewery so they can burn their clothes when exiting, but even that was not enough. After giving it more thought, we concluded that winemakers think Brettanomyces might scar their taste buds and possible even permeate their skin? Either way, Sanctification is one of the most unique beers you will ever taste! It was fermented with 100% Brettanomyces, rather than the traditional Saccharomyces."
1717,June
1718,"Belgian Brown Ale aged 3 months in Calloway Vineyard's red wine oak barrels with cinnamon, nutmeg (fresh, hand-ground) and Pumpkin + wild yeast."

1722,"An authentic example of a Bavarian Hefeweizen. “Hefe” means cloudy or yeasty and “weizen” means wheat. This beer is made with mostly wheat and uses a true Hefeweizen yeast that gives it a fruity, banana aroma with just a hint of cloves. The tart finish makes this the perfect summer beer."
1723,Ol' Jack Frost aged in Jack Daniels barrels.
1724,Celebrate the season with this rich and malty amber brew. The use of imported German barley and Noble hops assures the authenticity of this classic style.
1725,"This year years beer was referred to as a ""dark amber cream ale."""
1726,"A warming golden red glow beams right from the centre of this beer unveiling a clean aroma of soft caramel malts and a touch of dark fruit. The body is light and very easy, opening into flavours of grainy sweet toffee and very light hops."
1727,"Originally conceived along the lines of a Belgian Dubbel, Hell Hath No Fury... Ale morphed during development into something entirely different. Blending a pair of Belgian abbey-style yeasts into a recipe more akin to a roasty stout, Hell Hath No Fury... Ale offers up warm, roasted notes of coffee & dark chocolate together with the fruity & clove-like aromas."

1733,Previously released as B-to-the-E.
1734,"An American style pale ale with a medium body and plenty of hops.

It’s great for complimenting a spicy dish."
1735,"This American Cream Ale is very light in color and body and has almost no hop bitterness. Lancelot's is a refreshing brew, from the beginning, when its tangy carbonation hits your tongue, to the finish where its pilsner-esque malt and hop flavors subtly fill your palate."
1736,"This American Spiced Ale is reminiscent of your favorite autumn dessert: pumpkin pie. The nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon that create this beer's delicious aroma are balanced against the malts and pumpkin in this recipe to give this spicy treat its charming flavor profile. Lil’s Grumpkin Pumpkin is only available while supplies last."

The early residents of Lake Mills were forewarned of a guardian placed in its lake to protect its sacred stone tepees. And history tells of numerous encounters with Rocky, who became a source of great worry and fear. Although not seen for over a century, divers still experience a feeling of dread and being watched. Enjoy Rocky's Revenge, our offering to this legendary protector of Tyranena."
1741,"Brewed with two-row and roasted caramel malt for a rich color, and a blend of hand-selected premium American and Bavarian hops for balance and flavor. Budweiser Select spends approximately twice as long as regular beers in the brewhouse, which results in lower carbohydrate and calorie content after fermentation."
1742,"“Doppel” means double and this beer is double in every way. Bayern Doppelbock became an instant legend when Bayern introduced it in Missoula in December of 1987. Unlike its top-fermenting counterparts, this hearty German dark lager does not have the rough bite of a porter or a stout. Bayern Doppelbock is dark, smooth and has plenty of hops (Saaz & Hallertauer Perle) and malt. It has a starting gravity of 18 degrees Plato. Bayern Doppelbock is available in bottles and on draft from November through February, just in time for the holidays and the coldest months. Please enjoy this festive beer in moderation and leave your car at home if you are planning to celebrate with Doppelbock."
1743,"The previous four “extreme beer series” were all dark in color, and we wanted to try the opposite with this holiday brew. Our goal: the lightest color, the highest ABV, and only the four noble hops used in it! Of all our entries, this baby needed some aging to calm down the 14.1% ABV! After the hand cork is popped, faint grassy aromas fill the nose from the late Saaz hop additions. Let this bottle breathe after you open it, if you can find one!!!"
1744,"Our Salt Spring Style Winter Warmer, is brewed in the Old English Tradition. With a rich ruby colour, a complex fruity nose and 7% alcohol, Fireside Winter Ale is meant for sipping and savouring near a warm fire on a cold night.

1746,"Our Adam aged in American Oak barrels. First released in 2000, and released again in November 2011 in 12oz bottles.

1748,Also known as Menabrea 150° Anniversario Amber

1753,"""Otto Mulligan's Irish Stout"
1754,"""Our Extra Special Bitter is full of rich, complex flavors and is nicely balanced with a generous amount of Kent Golding hops. The Flash Flood name was our brewer's inspiration--it was August, a huge thunderstorm blew through town, caused areas of localized flash flooding, but our brewer didn't wait it out... oh no, there were thirsty patrons anticipating the introduction of a new brew that day! Then, as his trusty old Ford pickup plowed through the torrent of water running across the road, the as of yet unnamed keg in the back of his pickup would from then on be ""Flash Flood E.S.B."" The alcohol content is 4.8%."""
1755,"""This is an American style wheat beer. Some beer drinkers enjoy adding a slice of lemon to this brew for extra flavor. Alcohol content is 4.1%."""
1756,"""This amber lager has a three-malt combination and is lightly hopped. The result is a mellow, malty brew with a smooth finish. The alcohol content is 3.8%."""
1757,"Hops are literally leaping out of this aggressive and magical deep golden brew. The aroma of Columbus, Crystal and Centennial hop varieties strikes you first with notes of evergreen and grapefruit before evolving into a snappy and sharp hop flavor. The finish is very dry and calls you back for more. Yes, there is some malt here too, but mainly in a supporting role. This is one for the hopheads. Cheers!"
1758,"""Introduced at our first Octoberfest celebration, this German style lager uses a unique five-malt combination. It is finished with Saaz hops. The result is a beer that is slightly darker and bolder than our second Octoberfest offering, Vienna lager. The alcohol content is 4.5%."""
1759,"The Weizenbock is here. It is a variation on a Weizen beer. Remember, weizen is German for wheat. Furthermore, a bock beer is a big, malty beer which is lower in hops. In Germany, for a beer to be considered a bock it must have an original gravity (sugar content before fermentation) higher than 16.0ºP or 1.064 S.G. If a beer has a high original gravity it will most likely have a high final alcohol content. We can conclude from this that the Weizenbock is a strong German-style wheat beer."
1760,"""This style of beer was invented in England by train porters around the turn of the century. The porters would meet at the pub after work and mix an Irish stout with a pale ale to create a slightly more, mild dark ale. This porter is 4.2% alcohol by volume."""

1762,"A lightly hopped, light amber colored lager."
1763,"As a favorite to many of our visitors, Red Rock’s American Style Wheat Ale is our version of the classic. Red Rock’s Hefe- (meaning “yeast”) and -weizen (meaning “wheat”) is light in body and brewed with German Noble Tettnang Hops to give it a low hop bitterness. Hefeweizen is an unfiltered beer, which gives it the cloudy character most commonly associated with this brew. Boost your Hefeweizen with a lemon wedge for a twist."
1764,"Spawned from the Mild Ale, Brown Ales tend to be maltier and sweeter on the palate, with a fuller body. Color can range from reddish brown to dark brown.Some versions will lean towards fruity esters, while others tend to be drier with nutty characters. They have low hop aroma and bitterness."
1765,"Pale straw to deep gold for color. This all malt brew is well attenuated with a slightly malted palate. Most have a subdued fruitiness. Hop character is of the noble variety, leaving a mild to medium bitterness. A balanced beer, light bodied and reminiscent of a cream ale."
1766,"Spawned from the English Brown Ale, the Red Rock version uses American hops. The bitterness and hop flavor is evident. The recipe for this was created by original Red Rock brew master, Eric Dunlap."
1767,"Style Summer Ale, this tail-wagger’s already fetched a real name for itself in competition. Our premium barley rolls over with domestic and imported Golding hops for a delicate bitterness and cold, wet nose."

1769,"Our take on a Belgian Style Tripel Ale, brewed with spices and fermented with a Trappist yeast strain which lends hints of vanilla and creates a variety of complex flavors."
1770,"Many Mexican beer styles today are descendants of old Austrian styles, from when Austria ruled Mexico in the late 19th century. Our Dos Perros is made with German Munich malt, English Pale malt, and Chocolate malt, and hopped with Perle and Saaz hops. To lighten the body, as many Mexican brewers do, we add a small portion of flaked maize. The result is a wonderfully bready malt aroma, balanced with some maize sweetness and a noble hop finish."
1771,"This beer is named for the Kingston area’s rich historical heritage, is reflective of traditional tastes. Simply put, it’s a golden, crisp and refreshing beer. Whether it’s out on a Saturday night with the gang, or home with dinner midweek, Old Capital’s exceptional smoothness makes a great choice for every occasion."
1772,Imperial Stout aged for one year in bourbon barrels.

1775,"Alyssa, named after Brent’s beloved Porshe, kicked off our “Cyclone Series”. We plan on releasing a new beer, about 1,000 cases at a whack, every four months or so. We name them like you name hurricanes (alphabetically, alternating boy girl, boy girl) and we will make sure to stop on each letter—no National Weather Service wussouts when it comes to “q” and “x”. This inaugural brew was an award winning Brown ale. Its ABV topped out in the 8.1% range, but had a sweet smoothness that masked the high alcohol. Certainly worthy of its class five status, Alyssa blew in to town and flew off the shelves and has been permanently retired! If you still have some un-opened ones, save them! They might be a collector’s item one day."
1776,"This beer pours a deep, dark brown with a light tan head. Aroma is malty, roasty with coffee notes and some very light aroma hop. It has a roasted coffee and chocolate taste with a sweet finish."
1777,"Old Ruffian is a hefty, hop-forward barley wine. Seemingly mellow at the start with subtle fruit aromas and complex caramel sweetness, it quickly becomes aggressive with its bold hop flavors and huge hop bitterness. Ultimately, the big body, succulent sweetness and massive hop character come together to work wonders on your palate."
1778,"Seasonal bottled ale - 2006 release in gift tin is now available in some UK supermarkets. Note, strength amended as 2006 release is 5.0% ABV"
1779,"The first of the brews from Pittsburghs newest and MICRO-est microbrewery to hit the streets. Truly, a hopped-up American IPA with loads of Centennial and Cascade hops, and just barely enough malt backbone to balance it out. Our flagship brew"
1780,"This Barley Wine tops the charts! Big, complex and thick, this beer is a meal in a glass. It warms on the way down and for quite a while afterwards. This beer undergoes three yeast fermentations and spending over 120 days in the fermenter. When you are in an adventurous mood, try this international classic."
1781,"A medium bodied ale with a complex malt profile. Flavors of bread, caramel, and hints of dark roasted malts."
1782,Hop lovers rejoice!! A copper colored ale with medium bitterness but full of citrus hop flavor and aroma.

Think cocoa, cinnamon, lovely snow bunnies & a bear skin rug. Why, that dirty old Elf! Norwegian Wood is a sumptuous spiced dark lager with a nice malty feel. Celebrate the season in style with a pint of our wonderful Christmas specialty."
1786,The name says it all. This Old English Ale is full-bodied and well rounded. The deep mahogany color and sweet malty flavor makes it a favorite.
1787,"A roasted smoky taste with medium hoppiness earmarks this as a smooth Sweet Stout. Its thick rich head is characteristic of all Stouts. While the flavor profile is dominated by a semisweet maltiness, the bitter hops balances the taste."
1788,Formerly Gordon Xmas
1789,"Featuring intensely aromatic and flavorful notes, BJ’s Pook's Pilsner is a crisp, smooth German-style pilsner made with the best German malts, noble hops and lager yeast."

1944,"Have you read the description for the regular Crooked Tree yet? Well this beer is almost the same just double the flavor and alcohol. We actually took the Crooked Tree recipe and doubled all of the ingredients except the water, just the way a DOUBLE should be made. Big hops balanced with tons of malt give this beer a huge body. Although this beer is as cool as ""The Fonz"" when first purchased, it gets really mellow and smooth with some age. After a year or two stored in a cool dark place you'll notice the heavy caramel and malt flavors are trying to sneak past the hops. This beer is hugely delicious so it will need your undivided attention (the chores can wait....trust us). "

1961,Our version of the Imperial Stout style uses 5 specialty malts that produce the rich roasted and coffee- like flavors. It is brewed to a rich black color with a full body.

1962,Northern California Inspired Red Ale
1963,"As craft beer pioneers, we embarked on an expedition to brew the benchmark West Coast IPA. We ventured into the unknown and struck gold, discovering a tantalizing menagerie of hops. Simcoe for tropical and grapefruit zest, Columbus for hop pungency, Centennial for pine notes, Citra for citrus zest and Cascade for floral aroma are layered throughout the brewing process. West Coast IPA® exemplifies the Green Flash spirit of adventure and discovery."
1964,"Coeur de Saison - Heart of the Season! This is the second beer that Free State has produced using a blend of special Belgian yeast strains. There is just a hint of anise and a background pepperiness from the grains of paradise, but most of the flavor comes from the yeasts. Served unfiltered but fined, so expect a bit of a haze. (O.G. - 16.85P/1067. Hops - 25)"
1965,"471 is a small batch, limited edition ale that was created by our Brewmaster to separate the weak from the strong. 471 is a double IPA, that combines Pale, Munich, Caramel-30, Carapils and Torrified Wheat malts, with Chinook, Centennial, Simcoe and Fuggles hops. It has a big sweet mouthfeel, followed by more hoppiness than you've ever had at one time. Enjoy."
1966,"Go big with our First Trax Brown Ale! Brewed with eight specialty malts, we created a surprisingly smooth chocolaty and nutty brew. Refreshing and fulfilling, it's the perfect close to a day in the mountains all year long. Brewed with eight specialty malts this deep brown ale has a surprisingly smooth mouthfeel. Roasted malts result in a wonderful chocolaty & nutty brew."
1967,"Oats give this rich and very dark beer a silky mouth-feel with rich notes of chocolate and coffee. This very dark colored beer is well balanced with strong hop bitterness, made with Pilgrim and Fuggle Hops, and strong roasted malt flavor."
1968,"Golden Ale is our best selling beer- in fact, Golden Ale, Pilsner and IPA account for 75% of the beer sold at our restaurants. This favorite brew is made with Spalter Select, cascade and centennial hops and features a low bitterness, floral hop character and mild biscuit malt flavor."
1969,This straw-colored beer is dry and light-bodied with medium bitterness and fine hop. The people of Köln are very loyal to their native brew - drinkers in local pubs rarely order any other beer.

1971,"Generous amounts of roasted and black barleys give this Irish ale its coffee-like flavor and deep, roasted finish. It takes 7 different grains to achieve this flavor profile and the brewing of this fella is something akin to rocket science!"

1973,"Big Wave is light golden ale with a subtle fruitiness and delicate hop aroma. A smooth, easy drinking refreshing ale. The lightly roasted honey malt contributes to the golden hue of this beer and also gives a slight sweetness that is balanced out by our special blend of hops."
1974,"Harboe Christmas Beer 5.7% is an attractive golden beer with a nice head. The taste combines dark malts and glucose, producing the rounded bitter-sweet taste characteristic of Harboe's Christmas Beer."
1975,"The contents of the bottle is the same every year, but the label (made by Danish artist Irene Sirian) is different for each year."
1976,Developed by brewmaster Christian Luxhøj.
1977,Alias Poretti Chiara Originale

1981,Replaced with the Chocolate Hazelnut ale.
1982,"Crafted from page 50 of the Sleeman family recipe book, this dark ale reappeared in 1993. With its rich sugary malt flavours – from a mix of Pale, Carastan and Black malts – and aromatic hops, it's a red ale that shares characteristics with traditional pale ale as well as brown ale."
1983,"Winner of the World Beer Cup, Strong Scotch Ale style, in 2001."
1984,13.6 degrees Plato

1986,Fish Paralyzer is a Belgian-style pale ale that is moderately hopped with Tradition and Saaz. The grain bill calls for a combination of specialty malt to produce its sweetness and copper color.

1992,"If you are looking for something crisp, refreshing and pale (in the North American style), our Red Fife Wheat beer is your best choice. The (distinctive) wheat malt flavor is complemented by a hint of German hop and aroma to achieve the perfect balance. The name commemorates the wheat variety developed in Peterborough County which has grown across Canada in the early 20th Century."
1993,"England is rightly famous for its traditional draught ales, full of hop character, but moderate alcohol content; the kind of beer Dickens' Mr. Pickwick would have enjoyed. Our Best Bitter is a tribute to these ales, with a blend of malts creating a deep copper colour and full, rich flavour. This is balanced by enough hop flavour and aroma to make it earn the title ""Best"" Bitter."
1994,"The inhabitants of the rugged hills and dales of northern England and Scotland like their beer strong, dark and sustaining, with the mellowness of age. So it is with our Olde Ale, a hearty, malt-accented brew which lives up to the promise of its dark brown colour. This is not just any old ale, mind you, but Wilde Olde Ale, to honour the somewhat peculiar playwright."
1995,"Brewed exclusively with an enormous, almost reckless, amount of first harvest noble hops - Hallertau Mittelfrueh from Germany. 110 IBUs. The ""murkiness"" is from hop particles, which are literally in suspension and create a permanent haze. It's part of the overall experience, and was intended."
1996,Local name - La Blonde d'Esquelbecq
1997,"If the river were made of beer, it would run amber. First brewed as the house beer for our Santa Fe based steakhouse, Rio Chama Amber Ale has become a cult favorite.

Staying as true to the recipe as possible, the Headwall Alt is brewed using German malts, plus German and American hops. Like the Pale Ale, the Headwall Alt is cold conditioned, dry-hopped and krausened in the bottle or keg. Similar to the Pale Ale, the process takes about 30 days."

2026,"Porter is a style of beer which originated in London, England in the 1700's. It became very popular there until it's decline in the 1930's. A separate style of beer evolved from a porter, called a stout. Now a porter is typically the step between a brown ale and a stout in both color and body. Our Penance Porter is a robust porter. The color is very dark but not black. You may notice some dark red color. The aroma is noticeably roasty with a complex ester (fruit-like) quality. It is also dry hopped with Cascade hops, so you my notice a floral note in the nose. The body will be quite full and rich with caramel notes and more roastiness. When the beer finishes the bitterness from the hops nicely balances the caramel maltiness, then lingers for a moment before it's gone."
2027,"The big, malty scent of the Harpoon 100 Barrel Series Maibock is present just above the floral hop nose. The combination of five malts creates a full, smooth texture that yields a clean, dry bitterness. This is a full-bodied beer with a pronounced hop and malt character."

2029,American-style Barleywine aged in 1st use Heaven Hill Reserve barrel.

While most beers provide temporary bliss, FINNEGANS Irish Ale fills your soul with deep-rooted goodness. It’s charitably delicious, making it good in every sense of the word."
2042,"This beer has a very full and complex flavor that is best enjoyed slowly, allowing the different flavors time to develop on your tongue. You will find that it changes as you progress from the first taste to the lingering finish. The malty sweetness is well balanced and blended with hop bitterness, giving a full, rich blend of flavors. A generous quantity of pilsner malt is joined with a little bit of caravienne for color and some carapils for body, along with plenty of Munich malt for flavor and aroma. This beer is lightly hopped with Yakima Perle and German Hallertau."
2043,"This is an imperial IPA that features three very potent American hop varieties: Columbus, Chinook and Cascade . . . hence the name C3. Hops are added at just about every stage of the brewing process, from the mash all the way through to a very generous 'dry hop.' This beer needs a lot of strength to support all those hops, so note the high original gravity. (O.G. - 19.85P/1082. Hops - 95 IBUs)"
2044,Replaced by Two-Fisted Irish Stout.

2049,"The name means ""the Knight"". All the brews from this micro brewery got names from medieval titles."
2050,"While ales are fermented for relatively short periods of time at room temperature, lagers employ a special variety of yeast and much cooler fermentation temperatures to achieve their truly clean, dry flavour profile. Our Lion's Gate Lager has a light body, a very crisp palate and a soft, hop finish, which is imparted by the exquisitely gentle Czech Saaz hop variety. The Lions would approve."
2051,"The term ""Pale Ale"" dates back to the 1800s when all beer was dark brown in colour. New malting techniques led to the development of pale malt, a barley malt kilned at low temperatures which contributed very little colour to the finished beer. Hence the birth of Pale Ale, an amber- to copper-coloured ale you could actually see through. Plenty of British Crystal malt in the grist lends this ale its rich colour, its caramel maltiness, and adds the occasional whiff of toffee to the nose. An addition of American and German hops to the kettle at the end of the boil is used to suffuse our Pale Ale with a gently spicy hop finish."
2052,"During the heyday of the British Empire, India Pale Ale was born as a strong pale ale brewed especially to endure the rigors of the long journey to the colonies. In order to guard against spoilage, I.P.A. was brewed with a high alcohol content and with liberal amounts of hops, which act as a natural preservative. This ale's golden amber colour only hints at its full-bodied flavour. Its sumptuous maltiness is tempered by a goodly amount of bitterness and a mouth-filling hop flavour. In order to finish our I.P.A. with a truly fresh hop bouquet, we dry hop this ale in the serving tank with both East Kent Goldings and Mount Hood hops."
2053,"A Belgian Style brown ale that gets it’s unique flavor from our house strain of Belgian yeast and a delicate balance of spices. Brewed with candy sugar, Curacao Orange and Thyme."
2054,"A medium-bodied IPA which merges the best ingredients from both sides of the pond. Brewed with English pale and crystal malts, this IPA is dominated with the Simcoe hop to provide a very aromatic hop presence with distinct bitterness and hop flavor."
2055,"L’Écume porte fièrement son caractère insulaire. Il s’agit d’une bière blonde au profil rustique et aux accents salins qui témoigne de ses origines maritimes. Rafraîchissante, elle vous enrobe d’une amertume franche, appuyée par de belles notes salines et végétales créée par l’utilisation d’ingrédients frais issus du terroir madelinot."

2064,"Dry Hop Orange A conundrum in the world of beer styles. This ale does not fit any conventional beer style. Orange in color, but not oranges are added to this beer, this beer has hop characteristics of oranges and tangerines. Grist: Premium Two Row, Crystal; Hops: Amarillo, Cascade, Horizon."
2065,A golden ale with vibrant hop tones and a dry finish.
2066,"Per the brewmaster, Greg Hall, ""American Barleywine""."
2067,"A good solid stout packed with all the flavours you’d expect with an extra twist; great malt base, dark chocolaty backbone from two perfectly balanced sources, soft carbonation and a subtle taste of tart cherry in the finish. The Hop character is just present enough to enhance the chocolate malt & cocoa. Cocoa notes in the nose and a chewy yet velvety mouth-feel. Gorgeous lacing remains on your glass. This addition to our seasonal portfolio showcases our brewing skill, focus on quality, character and consistently great flavourful beer. Slow brewed and hand crafted."
2068,Belgian yeast and American grains provide the distinct character and flavors of this blonde ale.

2070,"Swedish juniper smoked whiskey malt, Svalöv hops Julita."
2071,"During the 1800's, when the sun never set on the British Empire, beer being shipped to the Far East always arrived spoiled.

2072,A cask-conditioned porter. Our rendition is lightly roasty with a nice chocolate flavor.
2073,"Vital Spark is a beer that is hard to categorise, occupying a space between stouts, porters and milds, but it’s unique character has created a loyal following, including among many of the top beer writers and judges. Starting with hops on the nose then giving away to rich, dark malt flavours, this deep red ale is full of roast barley in the grist and well hopped with Amarillo and Cascade hops to give a unique and delicious flavour."
2074,"Aloha! We named our creation Hawaiian honey the style of this golden beauty is aptly named ""imperial honey blonde."" One hundred fifty pounds of clover honey added to the kettle after the boil consists of around 20% of the fermentable sugar. Don't let the light color fool you. This beer is loaded with a variety of unfamiliar aromas and flavors, all pleasing we hope. The Hawaiian Honey was brewed with many unknown factors hiding behind the finish line. It is quite possible that it is it the first of its kind. Abv is a staggering 13.0%. Our biggest beer yet, here's to another great benchmark brew for Chicago Brewing Company"
2075,"Hundreds of years ago in Germany, wheat beers were considered 'breakfast' or 'after church' beers, a testament to their light refreshing flavor and a tradition of drinking them on weekend occasions. We invite you to enjoy our Hefeweizen (hay-fa-VEIT-sen) any day of the week."

2086,"A new Vertical Epic will be released every year, with the goal being to collect them all and have a Vertical Epic tasting once the final Epic is released on 12/12/12. Each new Stone Vertical Epic Ale will be release one YEAR, one MONTH and one DAY apart. This time around, we used no spices in the brewing of this beer. If you've tasted the beer before reading this, that may surprise you. The special Belgian yeast we used adds a distinctively spicy aroma and flavor. Roastiness, clove, hops, fruitiness, and those other great and funky phenols abound in the nose. What's in the flavor? You certainly get some dark roasted malts and alcohol overtones. What else? Hints of earthiness, chocolate/cocoa, hop spiciness, maybe even anise, and ... the incredible variety of complexities from the classic brewing ingredients of barley malt, hops, yeast and water, when applied with an artistic brewer's talent never ceases to amaze."
2087,"Our Belgian White is made with light pale malt, malted wheat, unmalted wheat, and oats. The oats are added to give a very light color as well as body to the beer. The wheat is used for a couple of reasons. First, with its high protein content, it is used to make the beer cloudy. Also, when it is mixed with the special Belgian yeast it will give a fruity aroma and taste. The beer is hopped very lightly with English Kent Golding hops so as to not overpower the spices. Finally, in keeping with tradition, it is spiced with coriander and orange peels. Also, like all other Belgian White beers, it is unfiltered. This will make the beer slightly cloudy, but it will also make it more flavorful. The result is a cloudy but light colored beer with a pleasant fruity aroma and refreshing aftertaste. Summer is approaching which means that an Abita Belgian White will be the perfect refreshment to get you through the sultry summer heat."
2088,"Strawberry Harvest Lager is a wheat beer made with real Louisiana strawberries, picked late in the season when they’re at their sweetest. This brew has earned quite a reputation in a short time, causing the brewery to up their production year after year.

2089,Also known as Summer Solstice Cerveza Crema
2090,"A lighter version of the classic celebration beers known as Marzen and Octoberfest, our Vienna Lager has a nice toasted malt character and a slight amber color.

2114,"An old favorite with a new twist, our Amber Chili Ale is a beefed up version of our popular Green Chili Beer. We created a malty amber beer and added our usual fresh Anaheim peppers. To create the real differnce we added Poblano peppers roasted in our stone oven. The resulting beer is a complex mix of hot green chilis, sweet roasted chili flavors and a mild malty brew."
2115,"Wit means “white” and is so named due to the yeast suspended in the beer. Wit is one of the wheat beers of Belgium. This beer is brewed with a light malt base of barley and unmalted wheat. It is lightly spiced with orange and lemon peel, coriander, and camomile flowers. Hopping is low with no bitterness. Perfect for those hot summer days with its crisp and refreshing taste."

Pilsner malt is used for the beers' light body, Belgian Abbey yeast adds fruity aromas, and the beer is finished with Saaz hops and an array of herbs, spices, juniper berries, and rose petals. Enjoy the complex aromas and flavors of SAISON FLORA."
2119,Our Blonde Ale is pale golden in color with a crisp profile highlighted by late kettle and dry hop additions. Roasted oats and flaked barley were added to the base malt to lighten the color and mouthfeel. Nugget and Crystal hops contribute spicy and citrus flavors.

2121,"Brewed to celebrate Ben Franklins 300th birthday. Brewpubs across the country have brewed a reciepe similar to beer that Ben Franklin might have enjoyed during his lifetime. Our version uses corn, barley, and oats, along with some molasses, to create a light bodied slightly dark ale.

The ABV is 5.6%, making it similar to the Old Ale beer style, which is the beer style attributed to early English brewing."

2124,"Known as FBC, this is a malty brown base beer that is aged on tart cherries for a few months. Subtle cherry aromas complement the mild tart cherry finish in this malty brown ale. This is only one of two fruit beers produced at Flat Branch."

This is a big beer at 11% ABV and 75 BU's, or bitterness units. It is amber to copper in color and generously dry hopped with 7.5 pounds of Nelson Savin and Galaxy hops that assertively compliment the malt flavors. Enjoy the fresh hop aroma and flavors this holiday season."
2134,"Often called a ""dunkel lager"" our Brown Lager is brewed with six malts, four of which are roasted for color and flavor. Hopping is low to allow the malt flavors to dominate. A classic German yeast strain is used for fermentation."
2135,Our version of Scottish Ale is the 80 schilling or export style. The taste is malty with no perception of hops to detract from the malty profile. The color is golden and fermentation used an authentic Scottish yeast strain.

A light, partial-wheat brew, we used over 330 pounds of blueberry puree for fresh blueberry flavor. $1 from the sale of each glass will be donated to Turtle Island Restoration Network (www.SeaTurtles.org) for sea turtle and marine conservation projects.Our basic wheat beer reciepe with 336 pounds of blueberry puree added during fermentation.The base beer was fermented with a lager yeast for a clean and light bodied beer, with very light hopping rates that allow the blueberries to be featured. A pleasant berry aroma with a nice blueberry flavor make for an enjoyable brew."
2137,"A tasty interpretation of an American Brown Ale, as a result of mislabeled bag of malt. A lot more hop flavor and assertiveness than our normal British-style Brown Ale."
2138,Our Red Wheat is a variation of our Honey Wheat. It is reddish copper in color due to a generous addition of colored malts that also contribute a slight caramel taste. Wheat malt is added to make up 50% of the total malt bill. Nicely balanced with a light addition of German Perle and Tettnang hops. A very easy to drink yet flavorful and light beer.

The rye malt adds rich body and flavor to the beer. Chocolate rye malt gives this brew a light nutty flavor. Weizen yeast contributes aromas of spice, bananas and cloves."

2143,The Dunkel Weizen is our American styled hefeweizen with colored malts added to give the brew its light brownish color with a hint of caramel and roasted flavors. American Crystal hops provide a slight bitterness and add a very light hop flavor. We used an American hefeweizen yeast strain that is flavor neutral.
2144,"Weizenbock is a hybrid of weizen and bock styles with the higher alcohol associated with bocks. Our version uses the Kristalweizen yeast which gives the beer a clear, rather than hazy appearance. A small amount of crystal malt was used for color, and hopping is low to allow the malt and yeast flavors to predominate."
2145,Our Belgian Blonde is a perfect spring beer made to be enjoyed while sitting in our beer garden. This is a light colored all malt beer fermented with Belgian Abbey yeast. Sazz and Goldings hops add a spicy taste and floral aroma. The Abbey yeast adds its distinct fruit aromas. A wonderful light beer full of Belgian style complexity.

German Perle hops provide a light bitterness, and the steam style lager yeast ferments nice and clean, allowing the smoked and dark roasted malt flavors to dominate."
2158,"Yet, another version using rye malt in the grist. In the brown rye, we add chocolate rye malt to give it a brown color and a deep roasted nut flavor. These flavors combine with the rye maltiness and spice, to produce a very complex brown ale."
2159,"We use all American-grown malted white wheat, premium pilsner barley malt and classic hops in our All-American Wheat Lager."
2160,McCoy’s version of a Shandy
2161,"A Belgian Style ale that's very pale and cloudy in appearance due to it being unfiltered and the high level of wheat that's used in the mash. Always spiced, generally with coriander, orange peel and other oddball spices or herbs in the back ground. The crispness and slight twang comes from the wheat and the unique Belgian Ale yeast used for fermentation. Sometimes served with a lemon or orange, but if you truly want to enjoy the untainted subtleties of this style you'll ask for yours without."
2162,Brewed especially for the heat of the summer.
2163,"Bock beers are strong lagers – though not all strong lagers are bocks. The term is best applied to a smooth, malty beer with a hint or more of sweetness. So, this lager beer is strong, of smooth character, and well balanced with hop and malt flavor."
2164,"Inspired by the American India Pale Ale (IPA) and Double IPA, more and more Belgian brewers are brewing hoppy pale colored ales for the US market (like Chouffe & Urthel), and there's been an increase of Belgian IPAs being brewed by American brewers. Generally, Belgian IPAs are considered too hoppy by Belgian beer drinkers."
2165,"Pours clear and gold with a one finger head that sticks nicely to the side of the glass. Its aroma is crisp and malty which is reflected in it's taste. Landing Light has a little more carbonation than our other house beers which complements its smoothness. This is a very easy beer to drink. If you like a good lager, this looks and tastes exactly like a good lager should. It has the distinct golden aura and smooth taste of many European lagers, but with that added bit of distinction that it has been brewed here at McCoy’s so you know it’s fresh."
2166,"Similar to a Hefeweizen, these southern Germany wheat beers are brewed as darker versions (Dunkel means ""dark"") with deliciously complex malts and a low balancing bitterness. Most are brown and murky (from the yeast). The usual clove and fruity (banana) characters will be present, some may even taste like banana bread."
2167,"A.K.A. Steam Beer, Or Here…Steem Beer"
2168,Our Wee Willy Scotch Ale uses Peated Malt in the mash. A “Peaty” malt flavor is the result – kind of smokey and sea-salty. Hopping is low but malt flavor and body is pronounced. Beer lovers will love this strong ale!!
2169,"The legend begins here. In 1880 Speight’s enters it’s flagship ale into the Melbourne Exhibition. It cleans up, winning 2 gold medals and gets a new name; Gold Medal Ale is born."
2170,"Our first attempt at a bock style and this dark lager was meant to be sweet and rich—many people commented it tastes like a piece of liquid candy! Huge percentages of the sweet chocolate malt coupled with almost 500 pounds of dextrose really gave this beer a unique twist that anyone with a sweet-tooth would die for! Named after our company’s president, Brent Ryan; it is must be nice to have your name on 27,000 labels…"
2171,"This Belgian inspired ale is fermented with Brettanomyces Lambicus, a wild yeast strain, and brewed with German Munich malt. This ale is very tart, almost sour, and not for the weak of heart."
2172,1059 OG; 34 IBU

2174,"Latin for ""wheat,"" Triticus is a strong and dark Wheat Wine style ale that's light and lively on the palate. The blend of 50% wheat malts, including caramel and chocolate, provides color and depth of flavor. Complex hopping and dry-hopping lends a delicate spiciness and just enough balance to complement its strength. Best shared with friends."
2175,"Gonzo is big, bold, and beautiful like the man it was brewed in honor of – Dr. Hunter S. Thompson. Roasted chocolate, coffee, and vanilla malt flavors are balanced with a unique hop bite. Buy the ticket and take the ride by pairing it with blue cheeses, smoked meats, BBQ, chili, chocolate and coffee desserts."
2176,"Originating in Belgium, this is a truly bilingual brew. Known as Biere Blanche in French, Witbier in Flemish and White beer in English. Unmalted wheat and oats are used in the grist to lend this brew its smooth, light body. Coriander seed and Curacao orange peel are added to the kettle to infuse this beer with a subtle, perfumey spiciness. The result is a light wheat beer with a fruity, tart finish - the essence of summer."
2177,"All ""vintages"" share the same recipe."
2178,Evolution Ale has its roots in Free State's Ad Astra Ale. The aroma hops have been changed to Styrian Goldings and biscuit malt has been added for a little toastier malt flavor. (O.G. - 13P/1052. Hops - 24 IBUs.)
2179,"This beer is fashioned after the Belgian wit, or white, beers so named for the protein haze that comes from using unmalted wheat. Another common trait with the Belgian wit style is the use of honey, oatmeal, sweet and bitter orange peels and ground coriander in the kettle. The honey provides a floral aroma that varies with each batch due to the changes in the honey from season to season. The coriander and the orange peels give a spicy, citrusy flavor and aroma. The oatmeal adds a silky smooth texture. It is gently hopped with Simcoe and Mt Hood hops to a bitterness of 16 IBUs. (O.G. - 13P/1052.)"
2180,"A lager beer spiced with sweet gale, juniper berries and angelica."
2181,"Previously Rex's Amber, now available in six packs and just called Amber Ale."

2184,"Water from our own wells, regionally produced barley malt, hops from the Hallertau and Tettnang and pure cultivated yeast"
2185,"Tenth Anniversary Ale was a beer brewed to celebrate 10 years of brewing artisanal Belgian style ales. A unique interpretation of our flagship Allagash White, Tenth Anniversary is a blend of two different whites; a sweet batch (brewed in February, 2005) and a dry batch (brewed in March, 2005). By blending the two batches, an additional complexity is imparted. Further complexity, most notably expressed by the delicate vanilla notes, was gained by aging some of the beer in new oak barrels."
2186,This IPA is brewed with 35% rye malt. The crisp malt character is layered with Warrior hops. Dry-hopped with Warrior and Simcoe.
2187,Full-bodied and smooth-drinking stout with flavors of dark chocolate and roasted coffee.
2188,"Let's travel back in time again for another Dogfish Head Ancient Ale (Midas Touch was our first foray and Theobroma our most recent). Our destination is 9,000 years ago, in Northern China! Preserved pottery jars found in the Neolithic villiage of Jiahu, in Henan province, have revealed that a mixed fermented beverage of rice, honey and fruit was being produced that long ago, right around the same time that barley beer and grape wine were beginning to be made in the Middle East!"
2189,"On this 10-year mark, Midnight Sun Brewing Company proudly releases its 1000th batch of beer - a larger-than-life Belgian-style Barley Wine (if such a style exists) simply called M - in commemoration of the enduring spirit that founded and sustains this little brewery in the extreme Northwest. Making M required a massive grain bill - seven seductive malts - boosted by strength-inducing Belgian candi sugar. Once original gravity hit 37 Plato, a frenzied fermentation ensued: four completely fabulous yeast strains, two of Belgian origin, transformed this sweet concoction into all that is beer. But not just any beer. A beer of madcap magnitude - 11.6% ABV. Character and complexity increased exponentialy while M meddled and mellowed for several months in all-American bourbon oak barrels. Blending the aged beer before bottling ascertained smoothness. M is mesmerizing, pouring dark and silky. Caramel and spice waft up from the glass; bourbon, molasses, leather and vanilla follow. The first taste proffers tobacco, burnt sugar and raisin with a sublime port-like finish, but bourbon - smooth, sensuous, brooding bourdon - is ever-present. The finish, a bit edgy like an American take on barley wine, provides the necessary leap toward overall balance. M is a precious gift to ourselves as well as you, seekers of beer-that-is-beyond-beer adventures... We are but mere mortals in the presence of M."
2190,"Genuine Honey Lager was introduced in 2005 in response to consumer demand for honey lagers. Labatt Genuine Honey uses genuine, all-natural, 100% Canadian honey to give consumers a softer, smoother taste. This naturally-aged lager is brewed to the same uncompromising standards applied to every Labatt beer. Genuine Honey Lager is the real thing!"
2191,German Pils malt / Saaz & Hallertauer M. Hops
2192,"This beer is a Belgian Dark Strong, black in color, it has aromas of rich dry malt and a slight caramel sweetness. Rich and smooth there is not any bitterness to this full bodied beer. The high alcohol level in this beer provides some balance of it’s malty palate."
2193,"A very light golden ale that is malty sweet, almost honey-like in the nose. This ale has a light to medium body and a very delicate flavor. Easy drinking, it has very low bitterness and a soft dry finish."

2195,English Golden Ale

2199,"This beer was created on February 20th, 2000. It is composed of six varieties of cereals containing a portion of rye, a variety of hop and herbs & spices. Fresh mint leaves are always used. This out of the box beer offers a delightful blend of spices and malts. An enchanting discovery that suits its name."
2200,"This beer was created on June 2nd, 2005. It is composed of six varieties of cereals and two varieties of hops in six additions. Dry hopping is a technique that consists in adding hop leaves during the maturation in the fermentor before kegging. This gives the sensation of crunching on a hop cone. For true hop lovers."
2201,Millennium is brewed in the barley wine style to commemorate our 1000th batch of beer. Its generous hopping & bottle conditioning allow this beer to be cellared and enjoyed for many years.
2202,"An alias for ""Ceres Selection""."
2203,"A Classic Pre-Prohibition style of American lager that died out during Prohibition. Made from German Pilsner Malt and 26% flaked rice to dilute the excessive protein levels, giving it a slight sweetness that is offset by good hop levels. Medium to high malt and hop flavor and aroma. We use German Tettnanger and American Millenium & Palisade Hops."
2204,"Our Hefeweizen is a golden, unfiltered wheat beer. The wheat malt used in this beer lends a citrus-like flavor that is often accentuated with a slice of lemon. Hop bitterness is low and the yeast left in suspension in the beer adds a bread-like quality to the beer."
2205,This is an American Pale ale made with hops playing center stage. The unique simcoe hop flavors this beer. Juicy malt keeps a lovely balance. A portion of oats provide a creamy texture.
2206,"Creamy, smooth, crisp, lightly hopped and straw in color, an early 20th century American-style Ale."
2207,"Our English style ale exhibits the full, rich flavor of imported English malts. The addition of unmalted barley contributes a dry, refreshing finish. Cheers; me lads and lasses! 2002 World Beer Cup Silver Medal Winner."
2208,"A golden export-style ale made from only malt and hops, no fillers or adjuncts. A brilliant golden colour gives a “sparkling” appearance as the gas escapes from the glass. The natural sweetness of the malt is perfectly balanced by the bitterness derived from the hops. This beer represents the way blonde ales were made 100 years ago."
2209,Named changed from Brand Urtyp
2210,"Maine’s first and only bottled year-round American Style Pale Ale. By style, American Style Pales tend to have a slightly lighter body, a more assertive hop flavor and a crisper finish (the best example of an American Pale Ale is the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale)."
2211,"This award-winning dark ale is surprisingly smooth and drinkable. Caramel, molasses and chocolate flavors fill the palate. Its sweet start is perfectly balanced by a roasted dry finish. Nitrogen-conditioned."
2212,"An imperial stout — a classic style so rich and flavorful that it was once the private beverage of Russian Czars. The profile is malty sweet, hop bitter roasted, full-bodied, alcoholic and deliciously complex. Beer doesn’t get much more intense than this!"
2213,Nutty Brewnette is an American-style brown ale. A blend of four different dark malts contributes to a flavor profile that is sweet with “nutty” notes. A healthy dose of hops makes this beer hoppier and more balanced than most English brown ales.
2214,"This version of Monk’s Mistress - aged in American Oak Barrels - takes seduction to the next level. Its dark, daunting flavors become softer, rounder and more fascinating as they meld with toasted oak and its prior tenant. This temptation is beyond irresistible."
2215,"A Trappist Tripel style ale. This light colored traditional Tripel is made with pils malt, candi sugar, and fermented with a Trappist yeast strain. Estery and Strong best describes this unique specialty beer."
2216,"Crisp, dry, golden color. Hopped with Northern Brewer and Czech Saaz and run through the hopjack with whole leaf Czech Saaz."
2217,"Brewer's Notes: The wheat beer world, stylistically, is both broad and deep. Most familiar to the Japan beer enthusiast, perhaps, are German-style Weiss beers and Belgian-style Wit beers. While both of these types are wheat based, their signature flavor characteristics stem from special yeast selection. Baird Wheat King Ale is neither a Weiss nor a Wit; rather, it could best be categorized as an American-style Wheat Ale. The yeast used is our standard house ale yeast, making the fermentation clean and neutral and leaving the spotlight to shine on the flavor contributions of wheat."
2218,"Brewer's Notes: Baird Natsumikan Ale is brewed with whirlpool additions of ample quantities of freshly peeled and stomped natsumikans that were grown in the Heda orchard of our good friend Nagakura-san. Natsumikans are grapefruit-like both in appearance (large, round, yellowish orange) and in flavor (tart and sweetly sour). The tart natsumikan flavor is supported by a big, sweetly malty wort base that is accentuated by a high mashing temperature. Additional citrus and floral notes are provided by an All-American lineup of hops: Simcoe, Horizon and Mount Hood. ABV is approximately 5.4-6.0%."
2219,"Brewer's Notes: The new beginning for Baird Bureiko Jikan Golden Ale in 2006 comes in its ingredient makeup. The malt base is exclusively German this year. Pilsner, Vienna and Carared malts from Weyermann in Bamberg have rendered a lighter body and crisper flavor than in years past. This malt base, together with the large additions of Japanese candy sugar, lend a spritzy and refreshing character to this otherwise strong Golden Ale (ABV approximately 6.2-7.6%) that is almost criminal. It is like a velvet blitzkrieg! A wonderfully clean and crisp hop bitterness is provided by additions of American Magnum and Horizon hops. An earthy, mineral like character is present in both the nose and the flavor and likely stems from the dry hopping with American Mount Hood hops as well as from the additions of calcium chloride and gypsum minerals to the otherwise very soft Numazu water. With time in the glass, this mineral nose gives way to a floral-sweet aroma."
2220,"This year (2006) marks the sixth annual release of The Carpenters Mikan Ale. As the name suggests, it is an ale made with fresh mikans (a tangerine-like Japanese fruit). We receive the mikans as a gift from the Heda orchard of our carpenter friend, partner and mentor  Mitsuo Nagakura. It would not be an exaggeration to say that he is the complete embodiment of the dedicated, uncompromising and passionate Japanese craftsmen whom we so respect and whom we strive to emulate. The Carpenters Mikan Ale is our modest attempt to pay tribute to Nagakura-san as well as to all great Japanese craftsmen. "
2221,2007 8.6% ABV
2222,"Brewer's Notes: Holiday Joy Spiced Ale 2005 is a robust, red-hued winter ale with a pleasant alcoholic warmth (approximately 6.0% alcohol by volume). Three popular Christmas-season spices (cinnamon, nutmeg and clove) are added to Holiday Joy at the end of wort boiling and this lends a magnificently festive aroma and pleasantly sweet spice flavor to the beer. Holiday Joy Spiced Ale thus can perform equally well as an aperitif or as a nightcap (or, for that matter, anywhere in between). It is enjoyed most fully, though, when imbibed in the company of friends and family."
2223,"Brewer's Notes: Wheat Wine is a beer style born on the U.S. West Coast in the 1980s (legend has it that the style was conceived and first crafted at a small brewery-pub in Sacramento, California). It has as its progenitor the English Barley Wine beer style. Wheat Wine, as a beer style, is characterized by a massively rich complexity imbued with a tenaciously strong-willed sense of balance. It is a style indicative of the irreverent creativity and unrelenting passion for beer that form the hallmarks of craft brewing in the West Coast of the United States. Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is crafted in homage to the skilled brewing artisans and fearless beer entrepreneurs that have pioneered craft brewing on Americas great West Coast."
2224,"Brewer's Notes: Kabocha is a Japanese type squash similar in flavor to pumpkin. The kabocha we use in Country Girl are picked fresh from the Heda vegetable garden of carpenter friend, Nagakura-san, cooked up to gelatinize the starch in The Taproom kitchen, and added to the brew in two additions: one major kabocha addition during mashing (when it is added to the malt porridge and liquefied by the heat and the enzymatic activity of the mash), and one smaller addition during kettle boiling. The result is a wonderful, subtly rich adult liquid porridge."
2225,"Brewer's Notes: Baird Public House Bitter is crafted with traditional floor-malted English Maris Otter barley and, in this 2005 version, is hopped exclusively with generous dosages of American Centennial whole flower hops. The color is a sparkling, translucent copper. The citrus-fruit aroma is soft and inviting; the mouthfeel is sprightly and tangy; the finish is dry and cleansingly bitter. Your palate will remain as fresh and alert after several pints as it is during the first. The alcohol percentage (by volume) is approximately 3.7%."
2226,"This is a classic Bohemian-style Pilsner. Its rich malt backbone supports a lovely and refreshing hop flavor and bouquet. It is brewed with soft Numazu water, German malt (Pilsner, Carahell) and American hops (Magnum, Perle, Vanguard). Its overall character is reminiscent of a cool breeze on a hot summer day. Available in both kegs and bottles."
2227,"This rich, deep Amber has a wonderful balance of caramel, clove and banana aromas, combined with the snappy crispness characteristic of German style Hefeweizens."
